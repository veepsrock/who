Because both parents died in the village, hunger step in. She has to travel from her village in Akwa ibom to port harcourt without knowing anyone in port harcourt. As she arrived port harcourt. No place to sleep. She has to start sleeping under bridge by Agip junction. That first night 2 young men raped her under the bridge with knife and she later became pregnant. So with her pregnancy, she kept on sleeping under the bridge with cold. One day GOD remembered her using Apostle chibuzor to rescue her with her pregnancy. After her rescue, she was taken to OPM free specialist hospital to register her for antenatal care . During her medical test it was discovered that she is HIV positive. Those boys has infected her. And her pregnancy was already 9 months and she has never visited any hospital before while she was sleeping under the bridge. So because she did not take any drug to prevent mother to child transmission, it was discovered her baby also has HIV. So today mother and daughter has been placed on antiretroviral drugs and they are doing very well. Many people don‚Äôt know that antiretroviral drugs ( HIV DRUGS ) are 100 % free in all government hospitals. Below picture is Apostle Chibuzor celebrating her daughters birthday. And she is getting healthy and healthy everyday. With prayers, drugs and good food I believe the HIV in blood will soon disappear. It‚Äôs not her fault that her mother was raped by HIV boys.","treatment,capacity","treatment,capacity,bioweapon,rfi,religious-practices,case-reporting,alternative-cures,vaccine-side-effects","treatment,capacity,stigmatization",,"bioweapon,rfi,religious-practices,case-reporting,alternative-cures,vaccine-side-effects",hiv,hiv,,,,positive,positive,,,
