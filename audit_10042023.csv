Because both parents died in the village, hunger step in. She has to travel from her village in Akwa ibom to port harcourt without knowing anyone in port harcourt. As she arrived port harcourt. No place to sleep. She has to start sleeping under bridge by Agip junction. That first night 2 young men raped her under the bridge with knife and she later became pregnant. So with her pregnancy, she kept on sleeping under the bridge with cold. One day GOD remembered her using Apostle chibuzor to rescue her with her pregnancy. After her rescue, she was taken to OPM free specialist hospital to register her for antenatal care . During her medical test it was discovered that she is HIV positive. Those boys has infected her. And her pregnancy was already 9 months and she has never visited any hospital before while she was sleeping under the bridge. So because she did not take any drug to prevent mother to child transmission, it was discovered her baby also has HIV. So today mother and daughter has been placed on antiretroviral drugs and they are doing very well. Many people don’t know that antiretroviral drugs ( HIV DRUGS ) are 100 % free in all government hospitals. Below picture is Apostle Chibuzor celebrating her daughters birthday. And she is getting healthy and healthy everyday. With prayers, drugs and good food I believe the HIV in blood will soon disappear.

The pay was very good compared to other places and we also got a lot of bonuses and allowances. Sometimes, you may not have to use your salary at the end of the month because the other allowances would take care of your daily bills. I quickly joined a cooperative where we contributed a percentage of our salary and the bulk sum was paid to us at the end of the year. The first bulk sum I received, I used it to set up a block industry which my wife manages. Gradually, we added sale of cement to it. Because of that saving, I was also able to put my children through good schools. When Covid came, the company decided to downsize and I was among the unlucky ones. What saved me was the business I had established. Thank God my wife is a good woman and has been managing the business well. At first, I had wanted to look for another job, but I am no longer young and will not be able to work as efficiently as before. I decided to register my car with a car hailing service instead. These are difficult times, especially with the fuel crisis, but overall, I can say it's been good. I keep myself active, I also bring in money home daily and my business is still moving on well.

Vaccination is the most effective preventive measure against Anthrax in livestock. Consult a veterinarian to develop a vaccination schedule suitable for your livestock. b. Antibiotics medication and Anthrax vaccination cannot work together. Animals cannot receive antibiotics treatment two weeks before or after vaccination. c. Use personal protective equipment (gloves, facemasks, goggles, boots) when handling sick animals. d. Regularly monitor livestock for any sign of sickness or unusual behavior. e. Immediately report cases of animals bleeding from body openings to veterinary authorities or agriculture extension workers. f. Do not process or move dead or sick animals. Quickly report to your veterinary doctor or authorities at the Ministry of Agriculture in your State. g. Maintain good hygiene practices on the farm through regular cleaning and disinfection of animal housing, feeding equipment, and water troughs. h. Ensure a clean and safe water supply for livestock and avoid using water from stagnant sources. i. Sick animals should be isolated, and strict quarantine measures should be implemented to prevent the spread of Anthrax to other animals or humans. Want to know more about #Anthrax?

Over 880,000 under eight children were vaccinated against polio type two following the just ended campaign in eastern province.
Speaking during a media briefing yesterday, Provincial Public Health Specialist Charles Fanaka revealed that a total of 880,678 children below the age of eight were vaccinated against polio across the province.  
Dr. Fanaka says the figure represents a vaccination of about 96 percent.
He however explained that the health office reported a total of 68 refusals from community members adding that these were mainly due to various religious beliefs.
He further revealed that Chipata District reported the highest with a total of 138,998 children who were vaccinated during the campaign, thereby attributing the development to the district’s high population.
Meanwhile, Lusangazi had the lowest with 21,171 vaccinated children.
The polio type-2 vaccination campaign exercise ran from 31st August to 3rd September, 2023.",,religious-practices,"vaccine-efficacy,capacity,case-reporting,rfi",religious-practices,religious-practices,"vaccine-efficacy,capacity,case-reporting,rfi",polio,polio,,,,negative,negative,,,

Even in heaven, plants are used for healing-Revelations 22:2. Africans should not denounce herbalism because of Islam or Christianity. There is hardly any disease that herbs cannot cure. Read Genesis 1:29. God created man to eat herbs. Most sickness on Earth occurs because we have shifted from this divine diet, to eat all kinds of food that put pressure on our bodies. Herbalism restores the divine balance in your body by resetting you to your factory setting. Prophets in Scripture regular practiced herbalism 2 Kings 4:39. African herbalism is not evil. Embrace it. If you have ever had malaria and took agbo as a remedy, or had psoriasis, eczema, or other skin problems and used ose dudu (AKA dudu osun), you would never call herbalism evil. African herbs are potent. And we should not allow Christianity or Islam to scare us away from our heritage. Our universities should be offering degree courses on traditional African herbalism. There is a reason why our ancestors lived longer and stronger lives than we do. It is because they never ingested chemical pharmacopoeia. They had chewing stick for their oral health and used eti-erin (aloe vera) as an antibacterial while using kaolin for their digestive health. They equally used ewe asunwon (cassia alata, or senna alata) as an antiviral medication. They cured impotence with the dregs of palm oil and by consuming unripe plantains, amongst other things. We should not let these ancient wisdoms die out. Neither should we be ashamed of them. These are African botanicals, and we should be proud of them.

This was demonstrated with Nma Gongoni and Umaru Lanle's group during an HIV/AIDS entertainment- education experiment in Bida. The result of such effort was mass awareness from 83.4 /% lack of knowledge of HIV/AIDS in pre- intervention assessment in 1998 to 100% awarenes and knowledge of the disease in post- intervention assessment in the year 2000 (Yahaya, 2000).

What is called “Toilet infection” is actually VULVAVAGINITIS; and it presents in different forms including, candidiasis, trichomoniasis, bacteria vaginitis, gonorrhea, clamydia, childbirth allergic reactions, viruses like HPV etc Don't blame the toilet!

As we remember her, it is essential to delve deeper into her story, for Justina was not merely a casualty of the virus, but a pregnant woman whose dreams of motherhood were tragically cut short. Born and raised in the vibrant community of Onicha, Ezinihitte Mbaise in Imo State, Justina Ejelonu embodied the spirit of resilience and dedication that defines healthcare professionals. Her selflessness knew no bounds, for despite the risks and dangers posed by this deadly virus, Justina relentlessly cared for those afflicted by it. And in doing so, she became a symbol of hope amidst the darkness that encompassed her. In her last moments, Justina fought valiantly to protect both her own life and that of her unborn child. Her courage and unwavering commitment to her duty were unparalleled, as she fearlessly confronted a formidable opponent, battling for the lives of others even as her own hung in the balance. But let us not forget that Justina Ejelonu was not alone in her sacrifice. Mrs. Evelyn Uko, a dedicated ward maid, also succumbed to the perils of Ebola in the line of duty. Their shared fate serves as a poignant reminder of the countless unsung heroes who lay down their lives each day to preserve the well-being of others. In commemorating Justina Ejelonu, we must also acknowledge the extraordinary Dr. Stella Adadevoh, who played a pivotal role in identifying and containing the Ebola outbreak in Nigeria. Dr. Adadevoh's unwavering determination and astute medical expertise were instrumental in safeguarding countless lives and her tragic demise serves as a stark reminder of the fragility that healthcare professionals face when standing against the dangers that plague our world. Let us strive to ensure that the memory of Nurse Justina Ejelonu, along with the countless healthcare workers who have sacrificed their lives for the greater good, remains alive within our collective consciousness. Through recognizing their immeasurable contributions and deepening our understanding of their stories, we can honor their legacies and inspire a future where such sacrifices are no longer necessary.

Work hard.

He denigrated them and castigated this vaccination campaign. He said, among other things, that he does not receive a free dose of vaccine. I summoned him to call him to order,” said this president of fokontany yesterday. Several residents of this fokontany slammed the door in the face of the vaccinators, who were going door to door to immunize everyone against polio. “The health workers no longer returned to these houses where there were refusals, during the sweeps, to avoid tensions,” he continues. Not all targets, newborns, children, young people and adults, are reached, according to the confidences of some health workers and community workers in the Analamanga region. “The number of people vaccinated in our sector has decreased compared to the previous campaign.
