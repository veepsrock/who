The vaccine, according to Hollywood journalist A.J. Benza, resulted in a bl%%d clot in his brain that led to him being “partially par@lyzed and bl+nd” in addition to a series of other complications. 
Benza claims the news was confirmed by a source close to Foxx. 
“Jamie had a bl%%d clot in his brain after he got the sh%t. He did not want the sh%t, but the movie he was on, he was pressured to get it,” confessed the journalist, who formally worked as a columnist for the New York Daily News, during an appearance on Dr. Drew Pinsky’s online show “Ask Dr. Drew.”
“The bl%%d clot in the brain caused him at that point to be partially par@lyzed and bl+nd,” Benza alleged, as he insisted his insider was “someone in the room” with first-hand knowledge of Foxx’s hospitalization.
Foxx was admitted to the hospital after s¥ffering a “medical complication” on Thursday, April 11, according to his daughter, Corinne Foxx.
“Luckily, due to quick action and great care, he is already on his way to recovery. We know how beloved he is and appreciate your prayers. The family asks for privacy during this time,” she said.

The Ministry of Health, in collaboration with county governments and with the support of WHO, UNICEF, and other partners, is conducting an Oral Cholera vaccination campaign from Thursday, 3rd August to Saturday, 12th August 2023. 

The campaign aims to reach approximately 1.5 million people above one year old in six targeted counties: Nairobi County (Kamukunji and Embakasi Central sub-counties), Wajir County (Wajir North sub-county), Mandera County (Mandera East sub-county), Marsabit County (Moyale sub-county), Homa Bay County (Suba South sub-county), Machakos County (GK Prison and Special school), and Garissa County (Dadaab refugee camps).

Today, the Ministry conducted training sessions for county and sub-county teams in the targeted areas to ensure effective implementation of the vaccination campaign.

Community members, parents, and caregivers are strongly urged to take advantage of this life-saving opportunity and ensure they get vaccinated, along with ensuring their children receive the vaccine.

In addition to vaccination, the Ministry advises the public to continue practicing essential public health measures, including regular handwashing, proper water treatment, cooking food thoroughly, and using latrines for proper fecal disposal. These measures are essential to prevent the spread of cholera and protect the health and well-being of everyone in the community.",[],['cholera'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Meet WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus

As Ethiopia’s health minister, he is accused of covering up three cholera outbreaks, calling them cases of watery diarrhea.

Despite the title, Tedros Ghebreyesus (or Tedros as he prefers) is not a medical doctor. He is the World Health Organization's first director-general who does not hold a medical degree.

This current appointment we have 14 Muslims and 2 Christians Governor Uba Sani should learn from the disgraceful way his predecessor left the scene don't use religion to govern a state like Kaduna. Kaduna Christians are one of the best brains in Nigeria the most educated in the entire North West. And if you are talking of population we have about 5m Christians in Kaduna which makes up 50% of the population of the entire state. I am not talking of Southern Kaduna, I am talking of entire Kaduna including Hausa and Fulani Christians. The Christians in the Northern part of Kaduna are far more than the Muslims in the Southern part of the state. Yet this people can not coexist with us. President Tinubu has since left that wicked agenda and he is trying by all means to please both Christians and Muslims in Nigeria irrespective of tribe. Copy President Bola Ahmed Tinubu and not Former Governor Nasiru Elrufai. Children are expected to do better than their father and not to copy their father. You should do better than your predecessor but not to emulate what he did in Kaduna State. Your Excellency Governor Uba Sani knowledge is different from wisdom. Wisdom is not going to school to get many degrees like your predecessor did. Your predecessor had many degrees but see how he messed up Kaduna State, because he lacked wisdom. Wisdom is combining the religious differences , the tribal differences that make up Kaduna State and rule effectively without bias that's wisdom. The last time I saw you speak was in throne room Kafanchan when Southern Kaduna Pastors forum invited you with other Aspirants. This is not what I heard you promised Kaduna Christians that day.

I love you all. With passion Instead of thinking and feeling bad about yourself, why not come to the family and enjoy good food. Thanks all my little princesses. I really appreciate you whether you are a guy or a lady. All I want is just to see you happy. . . . A man in red suit walked into Jack's room and as usual he was always with his cigarette and his red wine. The whole room was filled with smoke as he enjoyed his blues songs. . . . ""Our new research team had just made a break through in our long term research. Finally, there is a drug that can finally cure HIV ailment in few days. However, we would need massive funding to be able to finalize this procedure. Sir, all thanks to you, HIV would now become a thing of the past. Your name shall go down in the book of history for all generations to admire and sing your praises. "" . . . ""That means, I can finally be healed of my condition? "" Jack asked. And the white man in red suit replied""yes sir. It's just for us to finalize remaining procedures then we would go into mass production.""Jack took a sip from his drink and then he looked at Mr Manny, the white guy and he just didn't exhibit any form of excitement upon hearing this news. He said to the doctor""I am not so much keen on this your project. Inasmuch as I want to be free and healthy, I still have not reached my emotional fulfillment. I can't have rest when I have not dealt with those ladies that destroyed my life both emotionally and physically. I am not yet done with my vengeance. "" . . . Manny tried to persuade Jack to let go of the past, but instead of paying attention to his counselling, he rather ordered his men to push Manny out of his house. He was enraged by the news he had just heard. And to ensure that no one gets access to this powerful drug, he sent in a spy to go and destroy the formular and and to eliminate Manny if that would be the solution to halt the entire production. Jack was just focused primarily on revenge. And that was also the main reason why he wanted to become the president of the country. His plan was to create chaos and turn the entire country into his own personal interest. But he still had some medications which was sufficient in keeping his condition from entering the critical stage. Aside his doctor, no one knew about his HIV status. Not even his girlfriend, Sasha. . . . Mike was able to revive the two assassins who had been unconscious for some time.Many doctors had been employed to come over to the prison. They all tried to revive those two men, but they all failed. But Mike,even with little access to the right tools, Mike was able to save these two men who earlier on had tried to kill him for no reason. He was getting ready to leave the room when he noticed a gun pointing at his head. ""Am sorry dude. You are a nice guy. Full of potentials, but we can't let you leave here alive. As we are speaking, to you right now, the boss is waiting for our response. If we don't present your head before him, we all will lose our lives. You see why I don't have a choice? "" . . . There is always an option for every human being ""Mike said.""But since this is the case,You can go ahead with your plans.Mike closed his eyes and knelt on the ground. The chief began to shed tears just like the remaining members. "" You are a such a great guy.""He said to Mike whose eyes were still closed to avoid witnessing his own death. The chief tried to pull the trigger but his conscience wouldn't allow him do it. He began to feel his hands tremble. His feet were covered with sweat and he couldn't just pull the trigger. ""I can't hurt this man. I just can't"" The chief said as he furiously hurled the gun on the ground. ""Guys, our job is done! Let's get out of here. "" ""What about the boss? He would want his full head. What do we do at this point? "" His team kept on asking multiple questions at a time which got him furious. But he realized that indeed they were right. Jack would want to see Mike's head just to be certain the job had been completely fulfilled without a scratch. ""What do we do now? "" One of the gang asked. The chief breathed so heavily just to calm his nerves.He glanced at all his colleagues and then he said: ""Let's go back to his room and finish him off"" . . . Please who will give me a tight hug this afternoon and also a sweet kiss on the cheek? But don't do it if you didn't enjoy the story. I am talking about people that really enjoyed the stories. . . .

I haven't heard from u since u dropped the call on me the other day I tried questioning u. All the same my dear, don't forget I am your father, I built a home before u were born, so I'm ahead of u when it comes to managing a home. What u have caused your home is a disgrace to my home as well, all the same u are no longer a kid, u should have explanations to your actions. Talk to me as a father, u need someone to talk to, u really need a motherly or fatherly advise. Let me hear from u my dear.* Bella: (Reply) I'm so sorry dad. I'll call u later in the evening so we talk about this pls. Hours later, Bill calls his family doctor to enquire a few things from him. *On phone* Bill: Hello Doc. It's been a while we spoke. I'm sure you've been busy at work with the COVID-19 pandemic. Hope you are coping well. Dr. : Yh Bill, its actually been a while. U are lucky u got me on phone this morning. This is the only period I make calls, trying to hear from my children in Cuba. Bill: Oh really, I'm a really lucky man tho. Anyway let me not waste your time, let me go straight to the point. You have been our family Doc since I married my wife, she complains everything to u even headache. So I just want to know if she complained about any health problem to u recently. Dr.: Ohk, I think two weeks ago she sent me a text that she was feeling feverish and nausea. So I recommended a drug for her to try and get back to me, so she later texted me that the feeling is getting severe over days so I wanted to get a free day so I can visit you guys at home to check up on her. But it won't be anything serious than pregnancy if I may guess. Just take time to ask her. U know how they behave in times like this, and u should know ur wife better. Bill: OK Doc, thanks so much. I'll do exactly so. But kindly find time within the week and come check up on us. Pls come with temperature to test us OK. We stepped out days ago. We were careful anyway. Dr. : U stepped out!! Pls Bill kindly stay home with your family, the pandemic is no joke . It's more serious than what you see and hear on social media. We know what's going on, so pls stay home, I beg you. I'll come tomorrow morning to test you with the temperature. Stay safe, I got stuffs to do now. Later then. Bye Louis and Mina in a conversation. Mina: Louis, I'm seriously fed up with this your apology stuff. How can u continue telling lies and claim u are apologizing. I've been quiet as though I've not heard u speaking to your cheat partner. Upon all the mess u caused the family with that slot, u still have the guts to speak to her. Louis: Hmmm, Mina u won't understand. It's just because I'm confused and don't know how to go about this whole thing. Mina: I'm highly dissapointed in you. I never expected this from u. U and I have had conversations worst than this when u wanna do something naughty to keep something intact. Sometimes I put myslef in your shoes and allow u the chance just to make sure u don't cheat. What business do u have with this lady that u never made mention of all this while? how do you want me to understand and believe all u are saying today? My mum has realised I'm not fine and she is finding her way here to know what is happening to me. My mum knows me too well that she can determine from my speech when I'm worried.

From the airport to his hotel, take him through the route described below. This is a technique widely used by the Chinese when you arrive in Shanghai. They always make you arrive there at night and it's on purpose. Akwaba! “Welcome to Abidjan, a megalopolis of more than 6 million inhabitants. Your hotel is located in the commune of Plateau, approximately 14 km from here. At this time, we will be there in a maximum of ¼ ""of an hour, and a little less as soon as the Y4 ring road opens."" Just with this little sentence, you have already set the bar very high. The customer, s he has already experienced the traffic jams in Accra, Lagos or Cairo, immediately understands that there is a certain traffic flow in this city. You will still have to warn him that the day is a different story, although enormous efforts have been made to build roads and improve the urban road network since 2012. This is an extremely important decision-making point and it counts in business when, for example, we have to export products from Ivory Coast and that delivery times must be respected. After this first subliminal atalaku, get down to business. Be part of the promotion of “Bling-bling 8.0”. Abidjan is not strictly speaking a Smart City, far from it. Very far indeed! But if you are cunning, you can manage to give the impression of it. Pklafotage instructions for use as soon as you take off from the airport, here we go: “Hold this kit, it will be very useful to you. For independent travel, you have several VTC apps to choose from, they are reliable, precise and secure. The same goes for meals, on these three delivery apps you will find the classics, the famous US fast food, but also local, French, Lebanese and Asian cuisine. They also offer mail and parcel services, In & Out. For your small transactions you have mobile money, but this fintech app aggregates everything in one, allowing you to receive and send money from a bank account or from your electronic money wallet, to all networks, instantly. » This sentence is pronounced in 2 minutes. Reread with a timer and you'll see. But by saying it you place the customer at the heart of the type of services to which they are accustomed. It's very important that he doesn't lose his bearings too much, that will reassure him. He's not a tourist looking for adventure. He is a businessman so he needs precision, to move quickly and to be at the heart of an ecosystem that he understands, which is practical and secure. Their meals, calls, internet connection and travel must be continuous and facilitated. It matters and these are things that should not be trifled with. It is important to explain to him that here, as in Paris, Rio or Berlin, everything is digitalized and that daily expenses can be completely demonetized, as he is used to. It immediately gives an impression of modernity. After the speech, go full throttle. Put it in full view, without excessive comment on the dynamism of the construction sector, embodied by the crossing of Bietry; buildings are nothing at all, so be careful not to talk about them as if they were something extraordinary. On the other hand, showing that things are moving is important, because it is well known that “when the building goes, everything goes.” » Once again, be careful not to make a fool of yourself by pointing to ice cream parlors and shopping centers. Leave this bragging for the semi-illiterate activists paid to, all day long, bamboozle the masses with “Abidjan is New York, Cocody is pretty”. Go ahead and don't say anything. Don't hesitate to quickly detour through the exhibition center when leaving the airport: a guaranteed effect with this form of flying saucer placed on the ground, including for visitors coming from New York or Tokyo. On the other hand, you can comment and give details of utility dimensions etc. These first impressions as soon as you leave the airport last a long time. Take the three-level interchange of Boulevard VGE, the fourth bridge, don't forget to indicate that the prefabs below were used as accommodation during the Francophonie Games. It is important to situate the year, 2017, it allows this foreigner to find his way in time and understand that for almost 10 years “Côte d'Ivoire has been back” on the international scene, including sports. And tell him that these buildings served as a containment site during the Covid crisis, and are prepositioned to welcome populations during a major crisis.

The girl accepted to leave her uncle's place and went to the streets suffering, all the time crying, being hungry, being lonely and the last OPTION she had was to go down on her knees and pray to GOD till GOD answered her prayers. A woman came driving and saw the girl praying. She stopped and asked the girl to enter into the car. She took the girl and took her back to school, bought everything for her like her daughter. The girl completed education and as we talk right now, she has completed University and working at WORLD BANK . Even you, GOD can answer your prayers.

45e76b23-0fc4-4568-adbb-76899344deda,needsReview,"Abia State Election Tribunal: Alex Otti Suffers Major Setback as INEC Testifies Hearing continued Thursday, 10th July 2023 at the Abia State Election Petition Tribunal sitting in Umuahia, the state capital in the matter brought by Chief Okey Ahiwe, the PDP candidate at the March 18 2023 governorship election, challenging the declaration of Mr Alex Otti as winner of the election. Witnesses took to the box to give testimonies at the resumed hearing. First was the witness from INEC headquarters, Abuja, Barr Hadizat Abubakar who told the court that she was at the tribunal on behalf of INEC Headquarters, Abuja as a subpoenaed witness, informing that she works in the Election Party and Monitoring Department of INEC, Abuja. While testifying under oath, Barr Abubakar confirmed to the court that Abia State Labour Party on whose platform Mr Alex Otti contested the election did not submit its party membership register to INEC 30 days to its purported governorship primary election, as required by Law. While adopting her written deposition as her evidence, she tendered six other documents mentioned in Paragraph 4A-F as listed in her written deposition and a letter issued to her by INEC Headquarters, Abuja, authorising her to testify on its behalf. Under cross-examination by Counsel to the Respondents, the INEC official told the court that documents from INEC relevant to the case must be authenticated by their records department and certified by the the national headquarters informing that she had no personal opinion whatsoever on the matter. She agreed that INEC has state offices nationwide, they remain under the control of the Headquarters. A mild drama ensued when Petitioner's Witness (PW 16) who was also subpoenaed from INEC tendered her official ID card as a staff in the Legal Drafting and Clearance Department of INEC, adopted her written deposition affirming that Abia State Labour Party did not conduct any governorship primary election. At that point, she was confronted by Counsel to the Respondents who showed her a letter and a payment receipt which she admitted signing. However, on a closer examination of the contentious document, it showed that it neither had a name, nor does it have a signature nor a date, that was apart from the fact that it emanated from Abia State office of INEC instead of its national headquarters. Upon that, the letter contradicted the one PW 16 earlier tendered in evidence and adopted on oath, and which was certified by INEC Headquarters stating that INEC did not monitor any congress, convention or primary purported to have been held by Abia State Labour Party. Even though the documents were tendered as exhibits, Petitioner's lead counsel, Prof Paul Ananaba SAN, leading Elder Chibuike Nwokeukwu, Emeka Okpoko, Chief Henry Akunebu, Chief Sir Uche Ihedioha among other senior lawyers, vehemently opposed admitting the documents saying he would sate his reasons in his written address. Meanwhile, a lawyer who has been following the matter, Barr E. Ekeh, opined that it was obvious that Mr Alex Otti and the Labour Party were doing everything possible to undermine the authority of INEC Headquarters by tendering unsigned and undated documents from the Abia State office of INEC instead of relying on certified true copies from their headquarters. Suggesting that Mr Otti and Labour Party in Abia State have demonstrated sufficient desperation to conjure up invalid Party register and authenticate same using malleable INEC officials in their Abia State office. He therefore urged the petitioners to remain vigilant as equity aids only the vigilant and not the indolent. The matter was adjourned to Friday, 11th August, 2023.",,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If you are experiencing any of the above listed on my previous post then you need to follow my instructions. ➡️ My advice for you is simple, here are the 2 main things you need to finally get rid of this stubborn staph infection: (1). STOP USING antibiotics: Most of the antibiotics drugs sold in pharmacy stores are now ineffective to treat staph due to self-medication practices. Another reason is that staphylococcus infection is now resistant to most of these antibiotics. So, my advice is stop wasting money on antibiotics. (2.) Eat these foods like garlic, lemon, ginger, and honey that are widely known to fight infections, they are natural anti-microbial medicines, and works exceptionally well for boosting immune system. #Dothisandthankmelater | PERMANENT SOLUTION to CERNMRET STUBBORN RECURRENT INFECTIONS STAPHYLOCOCCUS VAGINA/ PENIS DISCHARGE GONORRHEA PAIN DURING SEX CANDIDATES FREQUENT URINATION >SYPHILIS TOILET INFECTIONS STDS WEAK ERECTION PID QUICK EJACULATION GENITAL HERPES LOW SPERM COUNT CHLAMYDIA WATERY SPERM HPV WAIST & BODY PAIN E-COLI ....& MANY MORE........","['rfi', 'symptoms-severity', 'variants', 'alternative-cures', 'prevention-individual', 'bioweapon', 'case-reporting', 'treatment']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As you may know, my face is all over the place during the campaign, promoting President Tinubu’s candidacy, but also getting attacked, insulted and was taken to the mud, but I don’t complain for not getting picked, why, because the picks were balanced and objective enough to start a unified and strong government. Government is a function of time F(t), the fact that I get nothing now doesn’t mean that I won’t get tomorrow. But I know when things are done the right way and I will support it even if it doesn’t favor me. This is the spirit that we must all carry in this country. Government is getting formed, the major part is done now. All we need is to do everything possible to support the success of the government program which in turn translates to the success of Nigeria. We have problems with the economy, food security and general security issues, our job is to stand behind our leaders to do the right thing for our country. The complaint time is over, the campaign is over, opposition is over, now is the time for governance.

Alexander Locke Johnson suffered a seizure and cardiac arrest on April 29, 2005, three and a half days after receiving his first set of vaccines. The vaccines he received were the DTaP, HiB and Hepatitis B combo (Comvax), inactivated polio, and Prevnar. He died as a result of seizure and encephalopathy that resulted from his two-month vaccinations on April 25, 2005.

“The day of his vaccines, he screamed for hours after receiving them.”

Through an independent autopsy, expert medical and legal testimonies, and years battling the Vaccine Injury Compensation Court, their case was proven true and they were awarded $250,000.

People look at me and ask, are you the one fighting, I said yes. As small as I am, I fight people. I get so angry easily. The Spirit of anger takes over me that when people are talking or doing nonsense around me, I don't talk back, I just look for something and stabb the person. I don't have the time exchanging words of abuse with people because in my mind, I reason in a way that if you can not beat me, why are you opening your mouth to talk to me.(Shekinah Glory TV) Anger took over me that if you are talking to me then, I will be quiet because I don't know how to talk back at people, all I want is to do something crazy to the person fighting me, get you off the floor and beat life out of such person and after the fight, people get afraid of me. That was the kind of life I use to live before. God has called me into a Spiritual battle but I was ignorant fighting physical battles. I was fighting physical war, fighting and exchanging blows with people.(Shekinah Glory TV) Not just with women, with guys... You don't say because you are a man, you can just talk to me anyhow...I fight you for it. Thank God for my mother, she's a spiritual person God put in my life. She said remember God called you... For some who have seen the story in Youtube.. I received the call of God and also gave my heart to Jesus Christ at the age of 9years old. My mom who has seen the call of God in my life said to me that if I go on like this, I will not get to where God want me to be. She said if I go on with this kind of life of anger, I will not fulfill destiny. My mom then prayed a prayer,I don't know if to call it a prayer or a curse, but my mom made a prayer and said she is going to tell the Lord that anytime I get angry, that the Lord should flog me""Olorun ma nae legba"" translated in Yoruba. She said God will deal with me anytime I get angry.. I actually overlooked it like it was meaningless but guess what? Everytime I get angry , I literarily fall sick. You will think something is wrong with me like i have malaria or something else. I will be shivering. It happened the first time time I thought it was normal until it continued...after sometime, I decided to borrow myself some brain. (I helped my thinking faculty). That prayer was said so that I don't miss it in life...so that I can fulfill the destiny God had planned for me. So that I will do the things I am doing now. If the Lord didn't helped me I won't be doing what am doing now. If the Lord didn't help me, you will not be blessed by anything am doing now. If the Lord didn't do that Spiritual surgery, that flogging, I will not be here today. I will not be a blessing to thousands. If God has called you Globally, locally and you have the call of God upon your life, a surgery needs to happen in you where you old life dies and you take up the new life of God. In the name of Jesus, the Lord will perform a surgery that takes away your weakness and hindrances to destiny fulfillment in the name of Jesus!!!

The pay was very good compared to other places and we also got a lot of bonuses and allowances. Sometimes, you may not have to use your salary at the end of the month because the other allowances would take care of your daily bills. I quickly joined a cooperative where we contributed a percentage of our salary and the bulk sum was paid to us at the end of the year. The first bulk sum I received, I used it to set up a block industry which my wife manages. Gradually, we added sale of cement to it. Because of that saving, I was also able to put my children through good schools. When Covid came, the company decided to downsize and I was among the unlucky ones. What saved me was the business I had established. Thank God my wife is a good woman and has been managing the business well. At first, I had wanted to look for another job, but I am no longer young and will not be able to work as efficiently as before. I decided to register my car with a car hailing service instead.

One problem we have as people of God is that we often forget that it is the same God that created the man of God, that also created the medical doctor. The God that gave the man of God the unction to function also gave the doctor the knowledge to cure ailments. Following the directives of your doctor is not a display of lack of faith as many of you hold preach. Don't displace the doctor's prescription, only to replace it with the pastor's instruction; it might lead to disaster and regret. Pray in faith, fast in faith but when the doctor says so, please do so. I read about a man who let his pregnant wife to die because he refused a cesarean section for the poor woman with a heart condition. According to the story, when he was confronted about the ugly situation, all he had to say was that he had an agreement with God that his wife would deliver like Hebrew women without CS. Because of this agreement he made with God, he let this woman who had a frail heart condition and who won't be able to bear the stress of labour because of the condition of her heart, die. You see, most times, it's ignorance that sends most persons to the grave. As a priest, I pray in faith, but I also take the medication prescribed by my doctor. Some will call me 'faithless,' but that doesn't matter; what matters the most is that I know that Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament before whom I spend hours everyday, created me and that he too created that medical doctor and gifted him the knowledge of science. I pray in faith but I take my medication according to the doctor's prescription; if you call me faithless because I admonish you to go the hospital and take proper care of yourself, what will you call your man of God who himself goes for weekly medical check-ups even while he admonishes you to pray and have faith and that you will be healed? For me, saying that ""from January to December I haven't gone to the hospital,"" is not a laudable testimony; I think it is taking a great risk. Early detection will save you from extinction; go and treat yourself even while you pray. When you are diagnosed with a heart disease, lungs problem, malaria or typhoid, you need prayers but you also need medication; combine both. Don't replace your medication with Olive oil because this prophet, Rev. Fr. Pastor or evangelist blessed it. Have faith but don't discard commonsense. Your servant, @ Fr.

On this occasion, the government spokesperson, Minister #René #Emmanuel #SADI, made an introductory statement presenting the quintessence of the “efforts” made by the power in place. The #Movement for the #Renaissance of #Cameroon (MRC) notes to denounce it that the introductory statement in question, by a sleight of hand, presents the collective budget resulting from the order of June 2, 2022 supplementing certain provisions of the finance law for the 2022 financial year by the Head of State as a subsidy of petroleum products when it was more effectively a question of taking into account the increase in oil revenues due to the explosion in the price of crude on the international market, following the Russian-Ukrainian conflict. Thus, the increase in the so-called subsidy which would go from 120 to 480 billion, or an increase of 360 billion CFA francs, rather reflects revenues collected by the State which could have induced a drop in the prices of the various #petroleum #products at the pump, especially since it largely covered the reduction in taxable values applicable to imports of refined petroleum products decided in the finance law. In addition to #hydrocarbons, the introductory remarks highlight the emphasis placed on essential products for which the State devotes efforts through tax and customs exemptions and reductions. These measures are taken for the exclusive benefit of importers without any impact on citizens as current prices on the markets are not impacted by them. Freezing the prices of basic necessities, after having brought them back to official levels approved by the State, is a more effective instrument in such a situation, which directly impacts the household basket. If the Chamber of Auditors opens an investigation today into the companies awarded the measures taken for the importation of basic necessities, it is almost obvious that, as in the case of the #Covid-19 markets, these are members of the government and their cronies who will benefit from it. The mention of maintaining the prices of the #kilowatt of #electricity and the #cubic meter of water unchanged for households raises questions about the influence of Russia or Ukraine in the production of these two resources in Cameroon. Is the government's primary role to raise prices so that when it abstains for a moment we should applaud it? When he talks about the structural measures to be implemented to contain or mitigate possible shocks, the government spokesperson's remarks are at once vague, elusive and vague, without any concrete proposals. However, the high cost of living is a palpable reality that breaks many Cameroonians on a daily basis and which, well beyond the Russian-Ukrainian crisis, highlights the resignation of the government in its missions to support citizens. Indeed, it is at least since October 2021, four months before the outbreak of the crisis in Eastern Europe, that Cameroonians have decried the growing phenomenon of the high cost of living in our country, without provoking the appropriate reaction. leaders. Do price controls still exist in our country? Because he refers to other countries in his opening remarks, it is good to remind the government spokesperson that Côte d'Ivoire has frozen prices on its market, that salaries have been increased there to compensate for the inflation and give purchasing power to populations and that the private sector benefits from support measures to continue to satisfy demand on the markets. This is one example among others. It is therefore clear that Cameroonian citizens are the ones left behind by government measures to combat the high cost of living. Since in the end, the prices of products will remain out of their reach, their purchasing power weak, while a privileged few and those related to the government will benefit from the state measures decided in this context as always. *The National President of the MRC Maurice KAMTO*",,"['covid-19', 'measles', 'smallpox']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

People look at me and ask, are you the one fighting, I said yes. As small as I am, I fight people. I get so angry easily. The Spirit of anger takes over me that when people are talking or doing nonsense around me, I don't talk back, I just look for something and stabb the person. I don't have the time exchanging words of abuse with people because in my mind, I reason in a way that if you can not beat me, why are you opening your mouth to talk to me.(Shekinah Glory TV) Anger took over me that if you are talking to me then, I will be quiet because I don't know how to talk back at people, all I want is to do something crazy to the person fighting me, get you off the floor and beat life out of such person and after the fight, people get afraid of me. That was the kind of life I use to live before. God has called me into a Spiritual battle but I was ignorant fighting physical battles. I was fighting physical war, fighting and exchanging blows with people.(Shekinah Glory TV) Not just with women, with guys... You don't say because you are a man, you can just talk to me anyhow...I fight you for it. Thank God for my mother, she's a spiritual person God put in my life. She said remember God called you... For some who have seen the story in Youtube.. I received the call of God and also gave my heart to Jesus Christ at the age of 9years old. My mom who has seen the call of God in my life said to me that if I go on like this, I will not get to where God want me to be. She said if I go on with this kind of life of anger, I will not fulfill destiny. My mom then prayed a prayer,I don't know if to call it a prayer or a curse, but my mom made a prayer and said she is going to tell the Lord that anytime I get angry, that the Lord should flog me""Olorun ma nae legba"" translated in Yoruba. She said God will deal with me anytime I get angry.. I actually overlooked it like it was meaningless but guess what? Everytime I get angry , I literarily fall sick. You will think something is wrong with me like i have malaria or something else. I will be shivering. It happened the first time time I thought it was normal until it continued...after sometime, I decided to borrow myself some brain. (I helped my thinking faculty ). That prayer was said so that I don't miss it in life...so that I can fulfill the destiny God had planned for me. So that I will do the things I am doing now. If the Lord didn't helped me I won't be doing what am doing now. If the Lord didn't help me, you will not be blessed by anything am doing now. If the Lord didn't do that Spiritual surgery, that flogging, I will not be here today. I will not be a blessing to thousands.

According to the TRUTH of this information, the time is to be 12 O'CLOCK and the venue is to be at the COMMUNITY SQUARE. But supposing some members of that community unknownly acted on the wrong information and were present either at the wrong venue or at the wrong time or maybe at the right venue but at the wrong time or were late and the gate was already shot before they arrived, they would definitely have missed out on that blessings and even if Their mistakes was an honest one, it would not spare them the disadvantage. Hence when such information is given, it becomes a sole responsibility of people who want to benefit to be on the alert, verify what they know and put themselves in harmony with it. Similarly, to benefit from God's provision of salvation, we must ensure to have the accurate information and then put ourselves in harmony with it. Speaking to the Samaritan woman Jesus said: the hour is coming, and it is now, when the true worshippers will worship the Father with spirit and truth, for indeed, the Father is looking for ones like these to worship him. GOD IS A SPIRIT, AND THOSE WORSHIPPING HIM MUST WORSHIP WITH SPIRIT AND TRUTH [JOHN 4:23-24] Yes! It is non-negotiable, our worship of God must be with spirit, that is, without the use of any material aids such as images and symbols and with truth, that is, According to the standard set out in the scriptures. Any form of worship other than this would be like availing one self at the wrong venue or at the wrong time or Both, either ways such like ones would sadly miss out on God's blessings. But can people genuinely think that they worship God in the right way even though they are not? Well, concerning certain christians in his time Paul said: I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God, but not according to accurate knowledge [Romans 10:2] Yes! people can be genuinely zealous about God yet not be worshipping in the way he approves, these explains why they are many good people scattered about in false religious organizations, hence the Bible gives a clear command: Come out from them and be separate.......... [2 Corinthians 6:17] Since our very everlasting future depends on worshiping God in the way he approves [Mathew 7:13-14], it is important that we heed that straight forward command. what then should we do to ensure that we are on the road leading off to everlasting life and WORSHIPPING in the way God approves? Speaking about some people he onced preached to Paul said: these were more noble-minded than those in Thessalonica, for they accepted the word with the greatest eagerness of mind, carefully examining the Scriptures daily to see whether these things were so [Acts 17:11] Yes! They didn't Just believe the message because it came from Paul, Instead they went additional step to confirm if what Paul was saying was inline with the scriptures. Was Paul offended, thinking that they didn't trust him? No! instead he commended them! In-line with this, the bible said we should pay constant attention to ourselves and our teaching. [1 Timothy 4:16] Jesus warned that many false teachers and prophets will appear on the world's scene on the last days [Mathew 24:11] this have especially made it difficult, hence it is very important we imitate those zealous people of bible time that was commended by the apostle Paul and all the more so to continue paying attention to ourselves. Sadly, There's no color change test reagents that identifies one as a FALSE teacher or prophet so how can we identify them? Jesus himself explains :Be on the watch for the false prophets who come to you in sheep’s covering, but inside they are ravenous wolves. By their fruits you will recognize them. Never do people gather grapes from thorns or figs from thistles, do they? Likewise, every good tree produces fine fruit, but every rotten tree produces worthless fruit. A good tree cannot bear worthless fruit, nor can a rotten tree produce fine fruit. Every tree not producing fine fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. Really, then, by their fruits you will (truncated) | Are All ""Christians"" Christian?

bd5fe495-844c-48f9-8ddf-044c5b5a2ca7,needsReview,"RHAPSODY OF REALITIES (TeeVo—FOR TEENS) Tuesday, 5th September 2023 Pastor Chris YOU’RE WHAT YOU EAT (Feed On God’s Word Through Study And Meditation 📖TO THE BIBLE John 6:63 RSV “It is the spirit that gives life, the flesh is of no avail; the words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life.” ▶️LET’S TALK Ella didn’t understand that her food habits had a significant impact on her body. She had been secretly binging on certain meals and then purging them to prevent weight gain in an unhealthy manner. In the long run, these practices had negative effects on her body. However, when she eventually made a positive change by eating properly and incorporating a variety of foods into her diet, she experienced improvements in her overall health and well-being. You’ve probably heard the saying, “You are what you eat,” and it holds true because the food you consume becomes a part of your body. Anything that doesn’t become a part of your body is eliminated as waste, while what becomes one with your body remains inside. This principle also applies spiritually: when you receive and digest the Word, it enters your spirit. Through meditation, you allow it to flow from your spirit to your mind. From your mind, it permeates your body and begins to operate within you. It becomes one with your flesh, and you become one inseparable entity. This is important because the Word of God is where the life of God is. Remember the parable of the sower who went forth to sow his seed? Jesus said, “...The seed is the word of God” (Luke 8:11). What’s a seed? A seed is the life-giving principle of anything. This means the Word of God is the life-carrying principle of God; the Word is the seed of God. When the angel spoke to Mary and she believed, she received the Word from the angel, and that Word became Jesus. When you receive the Word into you, it produces in you what it talks about. What does that mean? Remember, the Bible says, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God” (John 1:1). The Word became flesh and lived among us. Jesus Christ was the living Word, the Word in flesh. Now, we have the written Word. When you meditate on the written Word, it gets into you as the Word and lives in you as God. Hallelujah! This is why we’re indestructible. We live and abide forever because the Word in you lives and abides forever (1 Peter 1:23). 🎯GO DEEPER Colossians 3:16; John 15:7; Joshua 1:8 🗣️PRAY Dear Father, thank you for your Word that’s at home in me. Your Word produces in me what it talks about; therefore, I live a life of victory, success, prosperity and divine health always. Your Word is faithful and true, and I’ve given myself wholly to it, in Jesus’ Name.

The liver is a unique organ in the body that plays an important role. It is considered as one of the most important parts of the body and it should be taken care of. Sometimes the liver smells or is swollen and starts to cause problems for a person. But research shows that an enlarged liver is more like a symptom of a serious illness than the disease itself. So in this article, we will take a look at some of the reasons why the liver can be swollen and the symptoms that you should not ignore. Just sit back and enjoy this reading while learning something new about hepatitis. What Causes Liver Enlargement? 1. Cirrhosis; this is a permanent liver infection and it happens in some cases if a person does not take care of the liver disease and it causes permanent inflammation of the liver. It can have life-threatening consequences. 2. Non-cancerous liver lumps otherwise referred to as adenoma or hemangioma can all cause swelling of the liver. 3. Fatty liver disease: eating too much fat can cause fatty liver disease. If you are the type of person who abuses fat, then you should also prepare yourself for sudden enlargement of the liver as this is one of the causes of this. 4. Liver disease caused by viruses such as hepatitis A, B or even C or mononucleosis can also cause inflammation or enlargement of the liver. 5. Disorders or diseases that cause accumulation of chemicals in the liver can also make it smell bad. What are the symptoms? 1. Yellowing of the skin otherwise referred to as jaundice is one of the signs of liver enlargement. Jaundice can also extend to the eyes, so make sure you see a doctor once you start noticing any form of yellowing of the skin and eyes. 2. Abdominal pain especially in the right side of the stomach. Chronic abdominal pain in this part of the stomach may indicate an enlarged liver or other serious problems.

Drop what you've learnt from this and what advice can you give her Good morning, Madam,Please, I need help with advice and everything. My husband passed on when my our only son finished primary school. He was 11 years then. I could barely feed myself then. My sister inlaw came and took my son to the north to live with them. She promised me that she would help train him but she didn't send my son to school for 5 years he lived with them. After 4 years, I found out and asked her to bring him back for me. She dragged her feet for a year more before bringing him back. He came back to a different human being. He became so quiet and hardly spoke his mind. This was a boy who was very outspoken and always 1st in class before my husband died. At first, he didn't want to tell me anything. But the only thing he told me was that he can't continue schooling, that he will look for apprentice work to help me train his siblings. I have 3 children. He later found somewhere a bit far from home, but the person asked him to come and live with him. He refused to live with anybody because of the experience he had living with my sister inlaw. It was in the process of all these that he opened up to me what he went through. He was mol_ested many times by my sister inlaw's husband, who passed on last year. People should not blame me here. We couldn't speak out because we don't have anybody to fight for us. The day I couldn't help it, and I told my mother inlaw, she said it's not possible, that can my son defend the allegations if taken to the shrine? They are too fetish, I had to cry inside with my child because nobody would believe him when he talked. We treated a lot of infection when he came back, and he really went through pains until the last hospital we went to. After running plenty of test, they told us he has hepatitis B. I have spent a lot on medication and hospital admission on his head, and I am tired of spending on him, i dont have any savings any longer. My little provision shop is almost empty because of drugs, series of tests, and medications i buy for him. He is always sickly, and he always loses appetite. Madam, please let the doctors in your forum tell me what to do because he is my only son. Because of this his experience, I don't want my 2 daughters to visit anybody without me going with them. What can I do to help him because watching him every day struggle with his life is the worst experience of my life. Even a woman I trusted so much to tell my predicament is telling people that my son looks like he has HIV. She stopped her children from coming to see my children. Hide my id . I need the doctors who are very experienced to give me advice please. Thank you for reading. #copied😢",,['hiv'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Proverbs 13:20. THOUGHT FOR THE DAY: The quality of your company determines the quality of your destiny. In life, I have discovered that association defines destination. Company affects outcome. The quality of your company determines the quality of your destiny. I heard a story some time ago. A young lady, who was a virgin, went to see a medical doctor, and the doctor told her, “How can you still be a virgin at this age of yours? If you don’t sleep with men, you will get sick?” That must be a demonic medical doctor circulating an evil theory. By the Grace of God, I am a medical doctor and I want you to know that nothing like that has been medically proven. So, following the counsel of this medical doctor, the lady ignorantly and foolishly handed herself to a man who had a carnal knowledge of her. The most painful and regrettable thing was, at her first attempt at committing immorality, she got infected with HIV. The man did not only have immorality with her but also gave her HIV. What a tragedy! Beloved, you must be very careful of the people whose instructions you follow. You must be very careful of the people who speak into your life. Just like this lady, someone may attempt to smoke for the first time because of a counsel from a friend. Someone may decide to take alcohol for the first time because of a counsel from a friend. There are people in prison today because of the friends they associate with. You must know that friendship is not by force; friendship is by choice. Do not let anyone force themselves on you, and do not force yourself on anyone. Love is a command, but relationship or friendship is a choice. Even though we are commanded to love everyone, we are not commanded to make everyone our friend. So, love liberally but relate selectively. Love everyone but select your friends because your association determines your future. REMEMBER THIS: The quality of your company determines the quality of your destiny. ASSIGNMENTS: 1. Love liberally, but relate selectively. Be mindful of the people you associate with. 2. Disengage from every relationship or friendship that has a negative influence on you. 3. Always get a second opinion if you receive a dubious counsel such as the type the lady received. PRAYER: Lord, I receive the grace to disengage from any toxic friendship I am currently engaged in. I ask that You give me the right association for destiny fulfilment, Lord, in Jesus’ Name. FOR FURTER UNDERSTANDING, GET THIS MESSAGE: Fulfilling Destiny (Part 2). QUOTE: Who surrounds you determines what you can survive. It is a matter of association. Culled from the book “15 Kingdom Strategies For Survival” Dr Paul Enenche. DAILY READING: Ezekiel 25-27. AMAZING FACT: The Baird's whale, one of the beaked whales, has the most stomachs of any animal in the world, with up to 13 stomach chambers. PROPHETIC DECLARATION/WORD: Receive the grace to get disconnected from every destructive relationship of your life today in Jesus’ Name. #SeedsOfDestiny #DrPaulEnenche #DrBeckyPaulEnenche #LightHasComeTheGloryIsRisen #DunamisOgba #DIGCOGBA | Photos from Dunamis International Gospel Centre, Ogba Lagos's post",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chizi please let's go to the hospital. (Chizi crying) Everything would be okay, just go to the hospital. Chizi gets down from the bed assisted by Mezie. They head to the hospital and Chizi sobs on the way to the hospital. They arrive at the doctor's office and Chizi is panicking. Chizi's Mum tells the doctor what they came for.

You will see it kneeling and you will keep kneeling to keep seeing it. I know you have prayed a lot but can I tell you? You have not prayed enough! T.L Osborn went for a crusade someone and from the beginning of the meeting to the end, people were sleeping and nothing at all proved that God sent him to the people. This was the same land where William Braham just came out from and blind eyes were opening like water! Wheel chairs were being rolled like nothing.. God so showed Himself strong in that meeting.... And T.L Osborn started asking himself what happened that he could not bring God to the scene himself! This became his burden! He lost the desire to eat ""If you can not help me to help my generation, I am of no use to them, take me"" He tied a chain round his waist and entered his room for 36days, his wife will shake the chain from outside to know if he was still alive.... He was crying to God! He was busy on his knees when many in his time thought he was wasting his time.... They were busy on the tv with expired messages and he decided to wait on God for something authentic for his generation.... After 36days, he came out and outran everyone that ran on their foot when he was busy on his knees.... Miracles were happening from the door of that room as he stepped out! You see, if you don't wait on God, your generation is too busy to hear you... No one wants to hear what he heard before.... Many people are tired of rhymes and scheme and dramatic gesticulations.... They want to see 'God'.... Soon they will start leaving the big cathedrals where they are, to go to the place where a man who have found God is; the man may not know how to speak queen's English.... He may not even go to school.... Sir! People want to see God! And don't care the qualifications of who shows Him to them! There is a price to pay! You can be that man in your time that brings Jesus wherever he is brought... Oh! Maybe you are still following men up and down to give you handkerchief, heeeh! God is not too busy to give you Himself! How I wish you used that time to seek God, you would've found Him by now. Throughout Apostle Babalola's Life, the shortest prayer he prayed whenever he was alone was 3-4hours. He prayed sometimes for 52days stretch. This man was a ceaseless prayer man. He was once told to pray on and bless a new television because it was scarce those days and he laid hands on the television and prayed 3days nonstop in the Holy Ghost. He was alive as though he was not a man.... He traveled to many continents with his prayer band for crusades without any physical transportation or even visa.... They disappeared at will at the commands of God. He had encounters with the Lord physically one on one on several occasions. This sounds like foolishness if we say it today... But we will not stop! Something greater is coming! You see. God is not too busy to give you Himself but there is a price you must pay for that glory you have longed for... A satanist once said he was approaching a territory and a huge fire from earth reached heaven so he conjured a demon to go check, the demon ran off, he sent another, the demon never came back. He now summoned Satan and Satan told him don't go there o, it's Kumuyi that's praying there that even he (Satan) cannot near there. Sir, if you seek Him, you will find Him! In the time of JOHN G LAKE, his signature was used to raise the dead on several occasions.... Signature!!! How can you be alive and cancer kills people? How can you be alive and hepatitis kills people! God is in the secret place! Hide&Seek!!! There is a man, Uma Ukpai...a terrible fasting machine, he said he fasted to an extent in his life that Jesus came to him and told him not to fast again! Some of these men lived as though they were not alive and they were men as though they were not living.... Paranormal! Supernatural! ...Immortality! Brother! Sister!

There is a way God designed Himself to be known, as far as understanding the cosmos is concerned so that we don't arrive at erroneous conclusions about God. The more you know God and His Son Jesus Christ, the more in experience you will access grace and activate the full potential of the Zoe (eternal) life. In God's kingdom, knowledge is essential as far as walking in dominion and victory is concerned. In the Believer's journey of growth to stature and living out your prophetic destiny in full, concerning knowledge, we must be guided. There are many kinds of knowledge that are useful and not a waste. However, in a Believer's pursuit of knowledge, there must generally be both Supportive Knowledge which aids our spiritual stability, and Foundational Knowledge, upon which the supportive knowledge is built. It's important we know God accurately because arriving at many wrong conclusions about Him can lead to the detriment of our Christian experience. #RevealingJesus #ApostleJoshuaSelman #KoinoniaAbuja #KoinoniaGlobal | ΚΟΙΝΟΝΙΑ LP INTIMACY PARTNERSHIP FELLOWSHIP Jesus n Revealing TWEMMA f Koinonia Abuja koinonia.abuja abuja abujakoinonia koinoniaglobal | Photos from Koinonia Global's post","['bioweapon', 'capacity', 'case-reporting']",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Amobi Ogah, has appealed to President Bola Tinubu to release the detained leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPoB), Nnamdi Kanu, for peace to reign in the South East region, IgbereTV reports. Ogah, who is also the Chairman, House Committee on HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, made the appeal on Thursday shortly after interfacing with the Abia State Governor, Dr. Alex Otti, at the governor's country home in Isiala Ngwa Local Government Area of the state. According to him, the insecurity in the South East region is as a result of the prolonged detention of the IPOB leader. He, therefore, called on President Tinubu to release Nnamdi Kanu, as a show of love to Ndigbo. Ogah explained that the release of Kanu will expose criminal gangs that are using the detention to cover their act of terrorism in the South East. His words, ”The President has done so much. The only disagreement I have with him is the issue of giving us only five ministers in the entire South East. I think the President should have balanced it to show that really, he loves us. ""I was telling the world that Mr. President loves us. But the only way he can show that he loves us is to give us Nnamdi Kanu by releasing him so that insecurity in the South East will be reduced drastically. ""The issue now is that we don't even know those who are behind the insecurity (in the South East). IPOB will tell you they are not the one, ESN (Eastern Security Network) will tell you they are not involved. ""But some will say the reason is because they are holding Nnamdi Kanu. So my prayer to Mr. President is that he should give him (Kanu) to us as a gift. This will be the best gift he can give to the Igbo nation. ""Release him to us so that we can be able to know those who are really behind the insecurity in South East. When you release this man, we can see reason to hold anybody that is messing up,"" the lawmaker noted. Ogah, a Labour Party (LP) lawmaker, has been vocal about the current insecurity in South-East, and his Isuikwuato/Umunneochi Federal Constituency of Abia State in particular.",,"['tuberculosis', 'malaria']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The thing is that, two men are asking for my hand in marriage. One is illi/terate, and he is a businessman doing very well . The other one is a graduate, working in a reputable firm. These 2 people are good but the business man shows me so much attention and he is very caring. The graduate is also caring, but I beg for him to give me attention, and I enjoy his attention more than the business person. Like when I wake up in the morning, the business man calls to wake me up, he will check up on me, and he sends me lunch at work sometimes. He is a business person, but he is romantic, and he remembers my birthday more than the other person. The challenge I have now is that, in my entire life, my hopes are to marry a graduate like me. Because of my children, let me raise children with a learned person. I don't know what to do. Like now the business guy, I am the one doing some phone settings for him. He is an introvert fellow. The only thing he knows about the phone is to use and make a call, nothing else. He speaks English very well because he has traveled out and lived almost 7 years abroad and came back. But when I am with the graduate, we flow very well because we discuss work and all. In the last 3 months, I was so ill, the graduate guy, knew before the business guy. I told him on WhatsApp, and he said sorry, I should go get some malaria drugs from the pharmacy. He sent me 10k for it."" The business guys called me that morning, but I didn't tell him, but in the evening, I had to call him and tell him when my body got so hot and i couldn't help myself. He sent his driver to pick me up. He joined us on the way with his own car and took me to his hospital. They ran some tests, and I stayed admitted for 4 days before I got discharged. I told the graduate person but he couldn't visit me at the hospital because he is the branch manager and he couldn't find time to come. But he came the following Sunday and brought me some provisions. Last week Saturday was my birthday and the business guy called me , took me out and told me that he wants to see my people. The graduate guy I had to remind him on Sunday afternoon that yesterday was my birthday. He said he forgot and apologized to me. I am so confused about making a decision. The graduate guy has taken me to see his sister and introduced me as the woman he wants to marry, too. The business guy came from a large family of 10. He is the 8th child of his parents, and he is even marrying late at 39 years. When i asked him why? He said he had a lot of setbacks, and marriage was the last thing on his mind. That his business picked up back again, and he started building on his land at the city.The graduate guy is 33 . I am 29 years old, and I am a pharmacist. Please, I need advice. Hide my id madam Cynthia. Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Amba says she is tired of convincing him for marriage. Satya asks her to let him leave peacefully and asks Sai if she wants to accompany him to hospital. Sai says she will go by herself. Amba asks Satya to forget whatever happened in the past and start his life afresh. Satya rides his bike recalling the moments spent with his girlfriend who asks if he will get serious when she leaves his wife. Amba stops Sai and asks her to suggest Satya to marry and describes the importance of marriage. Virat notices Sai’s sari getting trapped in a cycle wheel and pulls her duppata away on time. Amba misunderstands him as a roadside goon and tongue lashes him for pulling an unknown girl’s dupatta. Virat tries to speak, but Amba continues to scold him. Virat says he knows Sai well and her dupatta was getting trapped in a wheel, so he had to pull it out. Amba continues. Sai stops he and says she knows Virat well and asks her to continue her shopping. Amba leaves. Virat asks who was that woman. Sai says Satya’s mother and asks why did he come there. He returns her mobile she left in his car and warns her to stay away from Satya and his mother. Pakhi meets an advocate and asks if he fights civil or criminal cases. Advocate says both and asks what is her problem. She says both. Sai reaches hospital where senior doctor Survase informs that medical council members would be coming any time, but Satya hasn’t come yet. Sai says Satya left long ago. Nurse informs that Dr Satya had come but left with nurse Sheetal. Sai asks if Sheetal finished a few tasks she gave her. Nurse says no. Medical council members walk in and meet Dr Survase. Dr Survase offers them beverage. They refuse and insist to go on inspection directly. Survase introduces them to Sai and nurse. Members start inspection. One of them inspects labor room and finds surgical equipment not sterilized. She asks who is a gynec here. Sai says she is a gynec here. Member reprimands Sai for her careless behavior and questions her credibility. Sai fails to explain her. Doctor says when their labor room is unsterilized, how will they handle medical cases. Satya walks in and says their hospital is well equipped to manage any medical cases. Member identifies him as Indian Medical council’s youngest member and says if he is in this hospital, they need not worry at all. Satya says he can show her whole hospital. Member asks Sai not to feel bad as its part of her job. Sai says she understands. Sai then walks to Satya’s cabin and reprimands him for taking his nurse away during duty hours uninformed and putting her into a tough situation. Satya listens to her silently. Sai warns him to keep his personal and professional lives separate and not interfere in her work. She then returns to her cabin. Sheetal walks to her and apologizes her for whatever happened today. Sai reprimands her next for failing to perform her duty and putting her in a tough situation. Sheetal reveals that she is a single mother as her husband died 2 years ago due to COVID, her son suffered a head injury and when she informed Satya, he rushed with her to treat her son; a goon troubles her in her area, so Satya drops her home and made sure that good is arrested. Sai offers her water to calm her down and says this all wouldn’t have happened if she had informed her about her situation beforehand. She then walks to Satya and apologizes him. Sai apologizing Dr. Satya for misunderstanding him and says she actually didn’t know that he is treating Sheetal’s daughter. She says if he or Sheetal had informed her beforehand, she wouldn’t have… Satya asks if she wouldn’t have judged him or Sheetal or their intentions, he doesn’t have problem with her anger but has problem with her thinking; she apologized for her anger, what about her thinking; one has to get closer to a person to understand them better, its good that he understood who she is and feels sad that she is like others who have small heart and much smaller brain. Sai returns home sadly recalling Satya’s words. Savi returns from home and hugs Sai. Sai asks why she is late from school today. Sai says today was her school project’s presentation day. Sai says she must have won the presentation then. Sai says its Vinu dada. Virat walks in with Vinu holding a trophy and today’s topper is Jr Dr Vinayak Chavan. Everyone clap for him. Pakhi says she is proud of her son and extends her hand to hug him. Vinu runs and hugs Sai instead, leaving Pakhi and her supporters shocked and Sai feeling happy. Vinu thanks Sai for her help and says if she had not taken her to her hospital, he wouldn’t have won this award. Bhavani says masta masta, he won award like Sai.

Ministry of Health, reports:


COVID and TRANSLATED

XBB variant


Everyone is advised to wear a mask because the new variant of the COVID-Omicron XBB coronavirus is different, deadly and not easy to detect correctly.

The symptoms of the new virus COVID-Omicron XBB are the following:

    1. There is no cough.
    2. There is no fever.

  There will only be a limited number of these others:

    3. Joint pain.
    4. Headache.
    5. Pain in the neck.
    6. Upper back pain.
    7. Pneumonia.
    8. There is usually no appetite.


COVID-Omicron XBB is 5 times more virulent than the Delta variant and has a higher mortality rate than it.

It takes less time for the condition to reach extreme severity and sometimes there are no obvious symptoms.

Let's be more careful!

This strain of the virus is not found in the nasopharyngeal region and directly affects the lungs for a relatively short period of time.

Several patients diagnosed with Covid-Omicron XBB were classified as afebrile and pain free, but x-rays showed mild chest pneumonia.

Nasal swab tests are often negative for Covid-Omicron XBB, and cases of false negative nasopharyngeal tests are increasing.

This means that the virus can spread in the community and directly infect the lungs, causing viral pneumonia, which in turn causes acute respiratory distress.

This explains why the Covid-Omicron XBB has become something very contagious, highly virulent and lethal.

Caution, avoid crowded places, keep a distance of 1.5 m even in open spaces, wear a double-layer mask, wear a suitable mask, wash hands frequently, even if everyone is asymptomatic (no coughing or sneezing).

This wave of Covid-Omicron XBB is deadlier than the first wave of Covid-19. So we have to be very careful and take several reinforced precautions against the coronavirus.

Maintain vigilant communication with your friends and family.

Do not keep this information to yourself, share it as much as possible with other family members and friends.",[],['covid-19'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

afa4be6a-24e5-4ede-b3d7-69374cee8c68,archived,"🍇🫑SEEDS OF DESTINY🔥 A DAILY DEVOTIONAL GUIDE BY DR PASTOR PAUL ENENCHE (DUNAMIS INTERNATIONAL GOSPEL CENTER) DATE: SATURDAY, 02 SEPTEMBER, 2023 TOPIC: BE MINDFUL OF YOUR ASSOCIATION SCRIPTURE: He that walketh with wise men shall be wise: but a companion of fools shall be destroyed.Proverbs 13:20. THOUGHT FOR THE DAY: The quality of your company determines the quality of your destiny. In life, I have discovered that association defines destination. Company affects outcome. The quality of your company determines the quality of your destiny. I heard a story some time ago. A young lady, who was a virgin, went to see a medical doctor, and the doctor told her, “How can you still be a virgin at this age of yours? If you don’t sleep with men, you will get sick?” That must be a demonic medical doctor circulating an evil theory. By the Grace of God, I am a medical doctor and I want you to know that nothing like that has been medically proven. So, following the counsel of this medical doctor, the lady ignorantly and foolishly handed herself to a man who had a carnal knowledge of her. The most painful and regrettable thing was, at her first attempt at committing immorality, she got infected with HIV. The man did not only have immorality with her but also gave her HIV. What a tragedy! Beloved, you must be very careful of the people whose instructions you follow. You must be very careful of the people who speak into your life. Just like this lady, someone may attempt to smoke for the first time because of a counsel from a friend. Someone may decide to take alcohol for the first time because of a counsel from a friend. There are people in prison today because of the friends they associate with. You must know that friendship is not by force; friendship is by choice. Do not let anyone force themselves on you, and do not force yourself on anyone. Love is a command, but relationship or friendship is a choice. Even though we are commanded to love everyone, we are not commanded to make everyone our friend. So, love liberally but relate selectively. Love everyone but select your friends because your association determines your future. REMEMBER THIS: The quality of your company determines the quality of your destiny. ASSIGNMENTS: 1. Love liberally, but relate selectively. Be mindful of the people you associate with. 2. Disengage from every relationship or friendship that has a negative influence on you. 3. Always get a second opinion if you receive a dubious counsel such as the type the lady received. PRAYER: Lord, I receive the grace to disengage from any toxic friendship I am currently engaged in. I ask that You give me the right association for destiny fulfilment, Lord, in Jesus’ Name. FOR FURTER UNDERSTANDING, GET THIS MESSAGE: Fulfilling Destiny (Part 2). QUOTE: Who surrounds you determines what you can survive. It is a matter of association. Culled from the book “15 Kingdom Strategies For Survival” Dr Paul Enenche. DAILY READING: Ezekiel 25-27. AMAZING FACT: The Baird's whale, one of the beaked whales, has the most stomachs of any animal in the world, with up to 13 stomach chambers. PROPHETIC DECLARATION/WORD: Receive the grace to get disconnected from every destructive relationship of your life today in Jesus’ Name. #SeedsOfDestiny #DrPaulEnenche #DrBeckyPaulEnenche #GospelOrji #DunamisRukpokwu #viralreels #viralpost #DunamisInternationalGospelCentre #newmonth #september #dailymotivation #dailyinspiration #daily #devotional",['symptoms-severity'],['hiv'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am the lady that posted the last time that I was born with HIV and I met a guy which I explained my condition and he promised to stand with me in any condition. I relocated close to his area and since I relocated close to him we have been staying together in one room I complained because we are not yet married but he explained things to me that he's learning a hand work and the person he's learning the hand work happens to be in the same compound with me so he's using the advantage to stay with me and be learning his hand work. But there's something he's doing that I don't like last month he's female friend was celebrating a birthday and the girl's boyfriend wanted to come for the birthday but was cashless this guy went and withdrew the money I was saving in my account and gave it to the guy and the most painful part is that I don't know how he knows my pin and my ATM card has expired, he made a card less withdrawal and I don't have phone to check the alert when I closed from work I decided to check my account balance through POS and my account was empty I became mad when I reached home I asked and he answered that he borrowed someone the money. To cut the story short the money I saved was 20,000. I started hiding my money under my bed and I don't know how comes he sees the money under the bed he used it without telling me I became angry and started quarreling with him with all the non...sense I have been enduring, I told him I am tired, does it mean I can't hide money cus we are in the same room? And since we started dating I asked him for money once to make my hair and this is a year plus I have never asked him for money cuz I understand that he's learning hand work when things get better without me asking he will give me, I told him I want a breakup because am fed up with everything and what came out of his mouth was that he swears if I should leave him that's how I will continue jumping from one boyfriend to the other and he will curse me and it will affect me for the rest of my life cuz he's infected with HIV already and I want to leave him😔😔 the one that pains me most am a baker my boss gave me a hand mixer for me to stop stressing my self this guy sold this hand mixer this is two days I have not seen my hand mixer 😭😭😭 pls my babbling sister's I need your advice pls🙏🙏🙏",['stigmatization'],['hiv'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We do this by empowering producers of these programs on modern radio production techniques during quarterly review meetings and linking them up with resource persons in government agencies, health facilities, and professional associations. On one such occasion, producers of the seven supported programs on the three partner radio stations in Bauchi State (Albarka Radio, BRC Bauchi, and Globe FM) converged in Azare, reviewed their performances in the last six months, received training in radio magazine production and came up with new topics for their programs on maternal and child health, nutrition and tuberculosis. #BreakthroughACTION | Photos from Breakthrough ACTION-Nigeria's post",['media-bias'],['tuberculosis'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10efe8aa-a507-4a8d-94ff-742e58fc3b81,needsReview,"SEEDS OF DESTINY DAILY DEVOTIONAL BY DR PAUL ENENCHE SATURDAY, 02 SEPTEMBER, 2023 TOPIC: BE MINDFUL OF YOUR ASSOCIATION SCRIPTURE: He that walketh with wise men shall be wise: but a companion of fools shall be destroyed. Proverbs 13:20. THOUGHT FOR THE DAY: The quality of your company determines the quality of your destiny. In life, I have discovered that association defines destination. Company affects outcome. The quality of your company determines the quality of your destiny. I heard a story some time ago. A young lady, who was a virgin, went to see a medical doctor, and the doctor told her, “How can you still be a virgin at this age of yours? If you don’t sleep with men, you will get sick?” That must be a demonic medical doctor circulating an evil theory. By the Grace of God, I am a medical doctor and I want you to know that nothing like that has been medically proven. So, following the counsel of this medical doctor, the lady ignorantly and foolishly handed herself to a man who had a carnal knowledge of her. The most painful and regrettable thing was, at her first attempt at committing immorality, she got infected with HIV. The man did not only have immorality with her but also gave her HIV. What a tragedy! Beloved, you must be very careful of the people whose instructions you follow. You must be very careful of the people who speak into your life. Just like this lady, someone may attempt to smoke for the first time because of a counsel from a friend. Someone may decide to take alcohol for the first time because of a counsel from a friend. There are people in prison today because of the friends they associate with. You must know that friendship is not by force; friendship is by choice. Do not let anyone force themselves on you, and do not force yourself on anyone. Love is a command, but relationship or friendship is a choice. Even though we are commanded to love everyone, we are not commanded to make everyone our friend. So, love liberally but relate selectively. Love everyone but select your friends because your association determines your future. REMEMBER THIS: The quality of your company determines the quality of your destiny. ASSIGNMENTS: 1. Love liberally, but relate selectively. Be mindful of the people you associate with. 2. Disengage from every relationship or friendship that has a negative influence on you. 3. Always get a second opinion if you receive a dubious counsel such as the type the lady received. PRAYER: Lord, I receive the grace to disengage from any toxic friendship I am currently engaged in. I ask that You give me the right association for destiny fulfilment, Lord, in Jesus’ Name. FOR FURTER UNDERSTANDING, GET THIS MESSAGE: Fulfilling Destiny (Part 2). QUOTE: Who surrounds you determines what you can survive. It is a matter of association. Culled from the book “15 Kingdom Strategies For Survival” Dr Paul Enenche. DAILY READING: Ezekiel 25-27. AMAZING FACT: The Baird's whale, one of the beaked whales, has the most stomachs of any animal in the world, with up to 13 stomach chambers. PROPHETIC DECLARATION/WORD: Receive the grace to get disconnected from every destructive relationship of your life today in Jesus’ Name.","['medical-exploitation', 'rfi', 'variants', 'corruption', 'stigmatization']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This young man of 14 years fell sick 2 months ago and was taken to the hospital where diagnosis indicated he suffered from Malaria. The parents treated what the doctors said, but to their dismay the case grew worse. From a family of doctors, he was taken to different hospitals for solution to no avail, and his condition kept deteriorating. His grandmother who is a Christian at Apostolic Gospel Mission advised they bring him for prayers, an advice which was resisted at first but however yielded to at the end. He was brought to his grandmother in Kumba, and it was at this point that she saw the enormity of the situation. The young man had lost his senses... He was mad!!! On Sunday 27th August 2023, in the late hours of the night, the young man became so violent at home that his mother and grandmother had to call for help from neighbors, he got so violent to the point of lifting the fridge alone, uprooting plantain trees in the compound, breaking glass windows at home just to name a few... The neighbors came, wrestled with him and only managed to tie him with ropes at about 12:20am after midnight. They brought him to church tied and bleeding, at the sight of him, pastors advised they take him to the hospital so his wounds can be treated before bringing him back in the morning, which they did. In the morning of Monday 28th August 2023, during the Upper Room Experience, 7 hours prayer retreat, he was brought to church still tied up for fear of him becoming all violent as he was the night before. As the prayers went on, the Man of God gave a prophecy about a hunter who killed a man in the far past in a family and the incident is hunting the descendants now. The young man's grandmother came out and the Man of God told her he sees her child mad, which she confirmed in tears and told the Man of God he was tied at the prayer line section of the church. The Man of God then asked that he be brought inside, he prayed for him, battling against the ancient masquerade and demons that came after the child's sanity and overcoming them in the name of Jesus Christ. After the prayers, the young man fell asleep, and the Man of God declared that he will be up delivered and healed after a while. And as the Man of God had said, while prayers were still going on in Church, the young man woke up, walked in the church premises and everywhere was filled with shouts of joy and praises to God for this mighty miracle. God indeed confirmed his servant's words with signs, wonders and miracles following. Over 2 months madness ended in less than 10 minutes after prayers by the Man of God. The family could not contain their joy, men could not hold back tears at the wonders of the Lord Jesus.

People look at me and ask, are you the one fighting, I said yes. As small as I am, I fight people. I get so angry easily. The Spirit of anger takes over me that when people are talking or doing nonsense around me, I don't talk back, I just look for something and stabb the person. I don't have the time exchanging words of abuse with people because in my mind, I reason in a way that if you can not beat me, why are you opening your mouth to talk to me.(Shekinah Glory TV) Anger took over me that if you are talking to me then, I will be quiet because I don't know how to talk back at people, all I want is to do something crazy to the person fighting me, get you off the floor and beat life out of such person and after the fight, people get afraid of me. That was the kind of life I use to live before. God has called me into a Spiritual battle but I was ignorant fighting physical battles. I was fighting physical war, fighting and exchanging blows with people.(Shekinah Glory TV) Not just with women, with guys... You don't say because you are a man, you can just talk to me anyhow...I fight you for it. Thank God for my mother, she's a spiritual person God put in my life. She said remember God called you... For some who have seen the story in Youtube.. I received the call of God and also gave my heart to Jesus Christ at the age of 9years old. My mom who has seen the call of God in my life said to me that if I go on like this, I will not get to where God want me to be. She said if I go on with this kind of life of anger, I will not fulfill destiny. My mom then prayed a prayer,I don't know if to call it a prayer or a curse, but my mom made a prayer and said she is going to tell the Lord that anytime I get angry, that the Lord should flog me""Olorun ma nae legba"" translated in Yoruba. She said God will deal with me anytime I get angry.. I actually overlooked it like it was meaningless but guess what? Everytime I get angry , I literarily fall sick. You will think something is wrong with me like i have malaria or something else. I will be shivering. It happened the first time time I thought it was normal until it continued...after sometime, I decided to borrow myself some brain. (I helped my thinking faculty ). That prayer was said so that I don't miss it in life...so that I can fulfill the destiny God had planned for me. So that I will do the things I am doing now. If the Lord didn't helped me I won't be doing what am doing now. If the Lord didn't help me, you will not be blessed by anything am doing now. If the Lord didn't do that Spiritual surgery, that flogging, I will not be here today. I will not be a blessing to thousands. If God has called you Globally, locally and you have the call of God upon your life, a surgery needs to happen in you where you old life dies and you take up the new life of God. In the name of Jesus, the Lord will perform a surgery that takes away your weakness and hindrances to destiny fulfillment in the name of Jesus!!!

Hadizat Abubakar, sent by Abuja, National Headquarters of INEC, confirmed on oath that, Abia State Labour Party did not submit its party membership register to INEC, 30 days before the purported gubernatorial primary election. *The Witness who presented evidence on behalf of the Abuja, National Headquarters of INEC, said she works in the Election Party and Monitoring Department of INEC, Abuja. She relied on her written deposition and adopted same as her evidence before the Tribunal. *During her oral evidence, she tendered the six (6) documents, mentioned in paragraph (4A-F) as listed in her written deposition and a, 7th document, which is the authority letter issued to her by INEC, National Headquarters, Abuja, authorising her to testify on its behalf. *Upon cross examination by lawyers to the Respondents, Barr. Hadizat maintained that documents must be authenticated from their records before National Headquarters will certify them. She insisted that she was at the Tribunal on official capacity because of the subpoena and has no personal opinion on the matter. The Subpoenaed witness also agreed that INEC has State offices but that the Abuja, National Office controls all other INEC State Offices and Formations. * Another Petitioner's Witness, (PW16), also a Subpoena Witness adopted her written deposition affirming that Abia State Labour Party did not conduct any gubernatorial primary election. She tendered her ID card and letter of authority from INEC and relied on same as her evidence before the Court. She confirmed working in the Legal Drafting and Clearance Department of INEC. *Upon cross examination, she was confronted by Otti's lawyer with a letter and payment receipt which she also confirmed signing as INEC's report, confirming it monitored Labour party gubernatorial primary election. Meanwhile, the said document has no name, undated and unsigned. *The Witness, PW16, contradicted herself as she has already tendered in evidence and adopted same on oath, a report certified by INEC National Headquarters, Abuja confirming it didn't monitor any congress, convention or primary election of Abia Labour Party. The INEC, Abuja authenticated letter has a reference number, name and date. *Upon close perusal of the documents which Otti's lawyer confronted the witness with, it was discovered that the controversial report claiming to confirm a purported Abia Labour Party gubernatorial primary election has neither an official reference number, name, date, nor signature and it emanated from INEC office in Abia State instead of the Abuja, National Headquarters that deals directly with political parties, thereby, rendering it a nullity. *However, the said documents were tendered as exhibit, while the Petitioner's lead counsel Prof. Paul Ananaba SAN, who led other Senior Advocates like, Elder Chibuike Nwokeukwu, Emeka Okpoko, Chief Henry Akunebu, Sir, Chief Uche Ihediwa and others, objected most vehemently to admitting the said documents and to give reasons for their objection during written address. *On the sideline after the court proceedings, Barr. E. Ekeh, who has been following the matter was of the opinion that Labour Party and Alex Otti are curiously seeking to override the authority of the National Headquarters of INEC by conjuring unsigned and undated documents from Abia State INEC office to counter the superiority of certified true copies from INEC's Headquarters in Abuja. He called the controversial document an after-thought from the Respondents which the smuggled in, even as they didn't plead it in their reply to the Petitioners petition. *He also said that his sources told him,(subject to confirmation), that Labour Party is in a desperate move to hurriedly manufacture an emergency, fake Party Register endorsed by a compromised Abia State INEC office into the matter as their defence. *Barr. Ekeh insisted that the information about the fake party membership register should be quickly investigated and exposed urging the Petitioners to be vigilant as Equity aids the vigilant not the indolent, ""Vigilantibus non Dormientibus Aequitas Subvenit."" *He concluded by saying ""with what happened today, it is now obvious that Alex Otti and Abia Labour Party is in a Cul De Sac as all their attempts to manufacture an emergency Party Membership Register to subvert the cause of justice have hit a brickwall"". *Matter was adjourned to tomorrow, 11th, August, 2023. | Photos from Aba Times News's post",,"['measles', 'smallpox', 'anthrax', 'chlamydia', 'dengue', 'filariasis', 'marburg', 'mpox', 'polio', 'syphilis', 'tetanus', 'cholera', 'gonorrhea', 'herpes', 'tuberculosis', 'rotavirus', 'lassa', 'meningitis', 'onchocerciasis', 'chickenpox', 'hantavirus', 'hiv', 'influenza', 'rabies', 'rsv', 'trichomoniasis', 'trypanosomiasis', 'zika', 'hpv', 'covid-19', 'ebola', 'leishmaniasis', 'malaria', 'schistosomiasis', 'typhoid', 'hepatitis', 'diphtheria']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We do not live by material. We do not live by money, relationships, we live by what comes from the mouth of God - The same yesterday, today, for and forever. 

He will release the heavenly ones. He will release the glorious ones. As we drink from the spiritual rock, we drink spiritual water. As we eat spiritual food from Him, He is that spiritual food. 

Therefore, I put that spiritual food into your mouth. I put that spiritual water into your mouth. Begin to drink; for it is the Word that has become flesh. It is the Word that remains the same yesterday, today and forever. That which comes into your life now, kicks out darkness, every demon, and every poison. 

This is the ultimate that comes upon you right now. This kicks out poverty, limitation, and setback. 

I speak right now. The Word has come into your life. You devil get out! You have been tormenting them, you have been limiting, and you have been causing sickness, and disease, get out! You have been causing them to be tormented, get out! 

It is the Word of life that has come. I am absorbing everything that has been tormenting you. Have you not heard of this Word of Mine? Death has been swallowed up by life - [Scripture reference 1 Corinthians 15:54]. 

This is the Word of life that has come into your life; swallowing up death, defeat, failure, set back, swallowing up that which has been standing in your way, swallowing up the chains that has been used against you. 

Disease has been swallowed up by this Word. This is the Word that has come to swallow cancer, diabetes, and blood pressure, kidney failure; chest pains, and HIV AIDS, and any disease. This is the Word that has come to swallow your arthritis, and piles. 

This is the Word that has come to swallow every death, sickness, in your womb. This is the Word that has come to swallow death in your liver. This is the Word has come to swallow death in your brain. This is the Word has come to swallow death.  

As the snake of the rod of Moses swallowed witchcraft, magicians stood in awe. I am saying, those who bewitched you shall begin to stand in awe right now. There is the Word that has come to swallow witchcraft in your life. 

This is the Word that has come to swallow witchcraft used against you. This is the word that has come to swallow every curse, every disease, depart.

This is the Word that has come to swallow evil desire. This is the Word that has come to swallow evil desire. All evil desires, all desires from the enemy, all desires from flesh, get out! Every weakness, evil in your flesh, I command it to go right down under your feet now. 

Every sickness, every tumour, you demon, go right down. I am opening a pit for you, go right down under their feet. 

You poison given in a dream, I command you, poisons, I call you now: ashes to ashes and dust to dust. You, poverty: ashes to ashes and dust to dust. You, set back: ashes to ashes, dust to dust. You, failure of marriage: ashes to ashes, dust to dust. 

Come out alive, right now, out of your dusty ashes. Wake up O sleeper, Christ begins to shine on you right now. Here comes your light.

The light is now shining upon you. The light has come, shining in the valley. All darkness departs. All evil departs. The life, the light, of God, has come upon you. 

That demon which stands against your marriage; we declare that finger-ring clean. We command that evil marriage: ashes to ashes and dust to dust. We command those evil dreams: ashes to ashes and dust to dust. 

The Word of the Lord has come; touching your lips, removing mistake, sin, and dust. What will dwell in your heart shall be the Christ, the Word – the Spirit of God. I declare your freedom.  I declare your strength has come in the Mighty name of Jesus. 

To God be The Glory!!!

County governments are currently conducting training for sub-county vaccinators as part of the Oral Cholera Vaccine campaign, which is scheduled to take place from Thursday, 3rd August to Saturday, 12th August 2023. In collaboration with @MOH_Kenya and  @WHOKenya, the training aims to prepare vaccinators in the highest-risk counties and sub-counties for the upcoming vaccination campaign.

With a target of 1.5 million individuals aged one year and above, the campaign places a primary focus on enhancing preventive measures against cholera in the identified regions. 

By empowering vaccinators with the necessary skills and knowledge, we are taking significant strides towards safeguarding public health and mitigating the impact of cholera outbreaks.

In response to the ongoing cholera outbreak that has affected the nation since October 2022, the Ministry of Health has taken decisive action by initiating a comprehensive Oral Cholera Vaccination (OCV) campaign.

During a media and stakeholders meeting held today in Nairobi, Ms. Mary Muriuki, the Principal Secretary for Public Health and Professional Standards, emphasized the urgency of intervention as the cholera situation continues to escalate.

As of 18th July 2023, the country has reported a staggering 11,181 cholera cases and 196 fatalities in 26 counties. The Case Fatality Rate (CFR) stands at 1.7%, underscoring the gravity of the situation and the critical need for prompt action.

The successful first round of vaccination conducted in February 2023 saw 2.2 million people above the age of 1 vaccinated in Nairobi, Garissa, Tana River, and Wajir, resulting in a significant reduction in cholera cases in those areas.

Building on this progress, the International Coordinating Group (ICG) has provided the Ministry of Health with 1,533,199 doses of the Oral Cholera Vaccine for the upcoming campaign. 

Set to commence on 3rd August 2023, the vaccination drive will focus on the eight most-affected counties, including Homa Bay (Suba South), Kajiado (Kajiado East), Marsabit (Moyale), Nairobi (Kamukunji and Embakasi Central), Wajir (Wajir North), Mandera (Mandera East), Machakos, and Garissa.
Ms. Muriuki emphasized the importance of additional preventive and promotive interventions to complement vaccination efforts. 

The Ministry of Health has strengthened coordination activities, water, sanitation, and hygiene efforts, risk communication networks, community engagement, patient case management, and laboratory confirmation of cases in collaboration with county governments, line ministries, and partners.

The Principal Secretary represented by Dr. Sultani Matendechero called upon all citizens to actively participate in the fight against cholera by adhering to essential public health measures and supporting the vaccination campaign. She also highlighted the crucial role of the media in raising awareness and educating the public about cholera prevention.

The Ministry of Health's announcement signifies a significant step forward in the battle against cholera, with hopes of curbing the outbreak and creating a safer and healthier future for all Kenyans.",[],['cholera'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Principal Resident Magistrate's Court in Lilongwe on Wednesday convicted and sentenced a 40-year-old man, Masamba from Dowa to 21 years imprisonment for defiling his nine-year-old biological daughter and infecting her with HIV.

The convict who resides in Kauma Township in Lilongwe was arrested by Lingadzi police some two weeks ago and pleaded not guilty to the charge of sexual intercourse with a female child contrary to Section 138(1) of the Penal Code.

Spokesperson for Lingadzi Police Station, Salomy Zgambo has told Nation Online that the child tested positive at Kamuzu Central Hospital ( KCH) and a child protection officer probed the issue and the girl eventually revealed that her father had been sleeping with her.

According to the spokesperson, the convict confessed in court that a witchdoctor instructed him to have sex with her daughter in order to get rich.

Principal resident magistrate Rodrick Michongwe presided over the case.

For 20 of those years, our teams have been adjusting strategies to assist communities facing the HIV epidemic, particularly in the capital city, Maputo. In this urban region, MSF established a crucial project focusing on HIV, tuberculosis (TB) and chronic viral hepatitis, which remained open until 2020.

In Nampula province, current MSF programs focus on providing care for people with neglected diseases.

In this three-question interview, Stéphane Foulon, MSF country director since early 2022, along with Ana Gabriela, an MSF medical doctor who has been part of the MSF project in Nampula for seven years in various medical capacities, offer insight into MSF’s medical work with tropical neglected diseases in Mozambique.

e63e3957-16da-48be-b4dd-1a6b5a4463fe,archived,"JOURNEY TO PRISON. Ep19 Like and comment. It's very important. Jack's guards were approaching the room and Edna could hear their footsteps clearly which meant that they were already very close. The lady with Edna had to come out with a brilliant plan which was to climb back into the roof where she had been in since the beginning of this journey. With the aid of the rope that she had, they were able to climb up before the guards could notice them. But along the way, Edna who could not replicate the exact speed of the other lady was stuck mid way. She tried to climb further, but the rope kept dangling around. Her heart began to beat so fast and her whole body was fidgeting. Jack was aspiring to be the next president of the country. Even though he was still young, he had greater influence than most politicians in the country. Four years ago, he was part of the contestants for the position of presidency, but the masses didn't believe much in him. He felt so devastated because he had spent a lot of his money trying to win the hearts of the people. That was when he unleashed his true nature. From that day until the next election, he went around causing chaos, he was responsible for the hiking of fuel prices. He also trained many militants who perpetuated crimes just to leave the country in a dire situation. Jack had made a vow with the god that he served. He was so desperate to become the president of the country that he was willing to do anything. So, to be protected from his enemies and also to stand the chance of becoming the next president, he was tasked with feeding on human flesh. He had a fridge where he preserved the parts that he needed. This was a very big fridge that no one had access to. He had to eat these fleshs raw just to remain well protected from any kind of attack. Jack also had his own grudges towards women for hurting him while he was young and also infecting him with HIV ailment. Each time he remembered the past, his anger increased in multiple folds. To get his own revenge, he decided to spread the same ailment to all the ladies in the country, as many as he could meet. He was worried when he realized that Dr Ronald had made his break through in his search for the cure. He knew that any further delay would grant Ronald the chance and the liberty to hand the cure over to the government, that, he never wanted. He didn't want the public to be healed. He wanted to be the only one with the solution so that the whole world would be under his control. He tried to persuade doctor Ronald not to bring his solution to the public, but Ronald refused. His own desire was to spread the cure across the country so that the people would be healed permanently. Seeing that he couldn't persuade the doctor to stop his mission, he resorted to the idea of taking his life. Even though he was away in another country, he still had that influence and power to summon his guards into action. He sent them to doctor Donald to assassinate him. In addition, he also wanted them to bring back the formula since it was now complete. However, the guards were not able to find this formular. They searched everywhere and no one knew where the solution was hidden. Not even the other doctors Mike had changed entirely from the skinny guy he used to be into an alpha male. The prison that was supposed to break him had in contrast built him into a hero. Mike was now bigger with his bulging muscles and his flat belly which reflected his albs and his six pack. He was always working out in the gym alongside Sasha and her female friends. After spending couple of months in that prison, he had won many battles and also saved many lives with his scientific knowledge as a medical doctor. Suddenly. mike turned from a weak fragile fellow to an Alpha male who was respected and admired by the majority of the prisoners. He urged the chief officer in charge of the prison yard to build more centers where prisoners could go and gym instead of wasting their lives in bad conditions. Mike assembled the prisoners and they all went to the Officers' department and for three days and three nights, they stayed just outside the gate shouting and screaming and protesting about the conditions of their rooms and the whole environment. Their rooms were not tidied up and the mosquitoes were ripping them of their blood.No good food eat. They were being treated like animals. Many of these people were innocent and were wrongly accused. It would be inhumane to subject them to such a disastrous treatment. Mike had seen people die because they could not adjust to such an unfriendly and unhygienic environment. Sometimes he cried a lot because he watched innocent souls die of petty cases that could have been avoided. He decided to rally the prisoners and they began a three day protest with no food nor water. They also did not do any work. Under rain and sunshine they remained without fretting. The officers had seen their will power, so they had no choice but to (truncated)",,['hiv'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Do not forget how special you are. Mike was able to get everything that he had requested from his officer friend. He had drugs, clean water and foods. ""Thank you so much Sir. I really appreciate."" Mike said.He wanted to leave the room but then he turned and asked. ""What does the outside world look like? It has been a while since I had heard or seen the outside world.I know so many changes must have taken place. "" ""You are right Mike"" replied the officer. ""However, the whole country is in chaos. The prices of everything had skyrocketed. The labour Congress are on strike. There are riots on daily basis from different agencies and factions. Everyone is complaining so bitterly"" ""Things have always been this way. Humans don't love peace. And their greediness will always create so many problems in the society. ""Mike said. "" Once again I appreciate your help so much.""Mike shook his hand and then he left. Sasha was in the room alone because her friends were outside doing their morning exercise. She heard a knock and she didn't want to respond to whoever was at the door. But when the knock persisted,she had to go to the door. Before Sasha, was Mike standing with a smile. She didn't smile back. She just left the door open and returned to her bed. ""Not even a welcome? "" Mike asked. ""Sasha, you have really changed a lot. The once lively and cheerful lady had now turned to a moody fellow who always stays to herself.Please let me into your heart. I believe I can really be of help to you."" Few hours before Mike's visit. Sasha had suddenly grown tired of living. She had had a lot of thoughts going on in her mind. She had cried throughout the night and that morning, she had made up her mind to take her life. She had gradually mixed some lethal substances and she was about to pour it into her mouth when Mike intervened. Mike did not even notice the potion placed beside the bed. His major concern was to cheer her baby up and to assist her in any secret challenges that she was facing. ""How are you doing? My princess. "" He asked and still Sasha didn't respond to his move. Somehow she was angry that Mike had just ruined her plans. Mike didn't pressure her to say her mind. Mike was a medical doctor, so he knew a lot about the nature of ladies and how to manage their moods. He began to rub his hands on her hair and Sasha felt this pleasant feeling rushing through her brain. In response, she slowly placed her head on Mike's chest while Mike continued to rub and caress her hair. She loved it so much. For the first time in several days, she felt like a woman. Mike knew that every woman wants to be pampered and treated with love and affection, that was why he allowed her to place her head on his chest. That was also the reason why he was rubbing his hand on her hair. ""I am depressed. I used to drink all the time just to forget my sorrow."" Then she breathed heavily as tears began to drop from her eyes. Mike could feel her anxiety and agony. She was really going through a lot. Mike, I am... ""But she could not finish the sentence. "" Go on my Sasha. You don't need to be scared. I shall never forsake you.Mike.said as he tried to encourage her. ""I am HIV positive"" She said. And this news sounded like a bomb in Mike's ear. But as a medical doctor, he was already used to such news. ""For how long now? Mike asked. "" Few weeks before I came to this place. You know the funniest part? It was the same man that infected me with this ailment,that also brought me to prison. ""What is his name and where does he live? "" Mike asked. But then his eyes glanced at the potion that Sasha had kept at the other side of her bed. ""If am not wrong,You were about to end your life right? "" Mike asked with tears in his eyes. Mike grabbed Sasha and he cuddled her so tightly""I will never forgive myself if anything happens to you Sasha. Please do not give up, Sasha. Have you forgotten that there is God in heaven? Have you forgotten that you were created for a purpose? 'His tears continued to pump out of his eyes in an uncontrollable manner. ""Mike I love you so much. But If I have had sex with you that day, what do you think would have happened? ""I don't want you to be like me."" She said with a quaking and trembling voice. She could no longer control her tears. ""Mike, I have fifty years to spend inside this prison. Fifty years Mike, fifty years. All these for an offence I never committed. "" I will cure you of this ailment. I promise"" Mike said with full assurance.But Sasha only Smiled.She lifted herself and looked deeply at Mike ""You are a medical doctor. and you of all people should know that HIV is incurable, even little children are aware of this fact.""

6bfd8aba-6002-45ab-bc32-48c7b0ce8a80,needsReview,"Inside Kaduna General Hospital Where Power Outage Frustrates Healthcare Delivery SINCE August 2022, the General Hospital in Sabon-Tasha, Chikun Local Government Area (LGA) of Kaduna State has been operating without electricity. In this report, The ICIR’s Nurudeen Akewushola chronicles how the hospital was thrown off the national grid, thereby crippling healthcare services in the facility. It was around 7 p.m. on a Friday. The premises of the General Hospital, Sabon-Tasha, appeared quiet, unlike the busy atmosphere of a typical general hospital. The disposition of both patients and their caregivers mirrored their dissatisfaction, as some had to abandon the wards to sit at the entrance to escape the suffocating heat. In an attempt to find relief, a number of caregivers and patients resorted to the use of placards to wave off the heat. It all began in August 2022 when the transformer supplying the hospital developed a fault. Though the transformer was later fixed, a year later, the facility, located in the heart of Kaduna Metropolis, remains unconnected to the national grid, thus crippling efficient health care service in the hospital. Since then, the hospital has relied on a generator as its power source. But this comes at a cost. The patients have no alternative but to bear the cost. The generator is fuelled by the fees charged clients for medical and laboratory services. Nurses rely on phone torches for ward round check: Faith Isaac looks tired and frustrated. Her child was admitted to the hospital due to malaria and that has kept her within the hospital walls for three days and throughout this time, she could not have access to electricity. “It’s frustrating because there’s not been light for the past three days that we have been here and the mosquitoes are everywhere,” Faith lamented. “When the nurse wants to go around to check the children at night, she will have to use her phone. Sometimes I have to borrow her my power bank to charge her phone.” She recalled an incident where she was nearly stung by a scorpion in the darkness but was saved by her torchlight. “Thank God I was using my torchlight, the scorpion would have stung me. The experience has been very bad,” Faith recalled. During a visit, The ICIR confirmed the absence of potable water either for drinking or domestic use. Though strange, findings showed that health workers, especially nurses, often go outside the hospital to get water at a cost. Relatives of the patients also do the same in some cases, due to the same challenge. Though the hospital has a borehole, the absence of electricity makes it impossible for the hospital to pump water for its basic needs. Kezia Amos, a caregiver from Angwan Gimbiya community lamented the persistent darkness at the hospital in the evening. She said there was no power during his four-day stay, forcing health workers to rely on lamps and phones for tasks due to the absence of power supply. Kezia Amos Garba Makama, a resident of Anwan Baro community, recalled a fateful day he brought his daughter to the hospital in the night, only to find out that the doctors were absent from their seats. The nurse he met was preparing to leave and they had to sit down in the dimly lit reception area. Suddenly, another patient emerged who was in need of emergency attention. The health workers wanted to attend to him but were all holding feeble torchlights amid darkness. This made it hard for them to locate the patient’s vein and inject him accordingly. “Because they were using torchlight, they were looking for his vein and when they saw it, they wanted to put the syringe in it but they couldn’t get it right and that’s how they ‘punched’ the patient like more than 10 times and the patient later collapsed and fainted,” Garba recalled. *Usman, a civil servant, has been admitted for five days and since then, he has witnessed the departure of three persons which according to him is due to lack of quality healthcare delivery in the hospital. He believes the hospital is lagging behind its counterparts. He said the problem extends to the surgical unit but once it is time for surgery, the hospital’s management would swiftly power the generator. “I have been here for the past five days and it has been a horrible experience,” *Usman lamented. “On this light issue, I think this hospital has been neglected. I have never experienced light since I came here. The only place that I experienced light was in the theatre. They powered the generator to operate on people. But at the wards, everybody has to use their phones or rechargeable lanterns.” Mirabel Esau, a resident of Sabon Tasha, decried the lack of electricity and water at the hospital, highlighting how these challenges impact patients’ comfort. According to her, washing the patients’ clothes and other necessary cleaning tasks have become a difficult assignment due to lack of water.

I looked myself in the mirror severally. Not long, Sola called me and we talked for long. He told me I am beautiful and that he wants me to be his girlfriend. At first I didn't know what to say but deep down within me, it was a YES for me. I started Dating Sola. His house was just 7 houses away from ours. So I do branch there to play with him and do my assignment. We were very free to do whatever we like and that was because my Uncle comes home mostly weekends, even my own parents don't call. Sola's parents too are not always around. They are always busy busy busy with work. This period, Rachael always come home very late. I wondered why. I later discovered that she always branch Ifeanyi's house after school. Even if we come home late, no one will question us. We were free. On a Saturday, I was in Sola's house. He has been demanding for kiss since we have been dating. That very day, we kiss€d. We ended up having S€x that day. I was ashamed of myself, I ran home immediately. I met my Uncle in the House, he came home early that day. Around 6:30pm, Rachael was still no where to be found. But my uncle didn't bother much. It was clear to me that She went to spend time with Ifeanyi in his house. I went straight to the room, I showered, changed my cloth and I heard my name. My Uncle called me and I know what that means. I went to meet him in his room. He started what he used to do. That day, we had s€x severally. Rachael came back that day when everyone had slept. It was in the morning my Uncle questioned where she went to the previous night. She lied that she went for a group assignment in her friend's house. My Uncle overlooked it as we prepared for church that day. My Uncle is not the church type. I can't tell if he was a Christian or a Muslim or a traditionalist. I felt I was at the peak of my life. Doing what you like without anyone questioning you seemed cool to me. I was dating Sola. He showed that he loved me. The truth is there was no one to Tell us if what we were doing was right or wrong. To I and Rachael, we were feeling like big girls. S€x no longer become something new to me. At times, I will have it with Sola in his house and also with My Uncle whenever he is around. One Wednesday, I came back home from school. I met couple of people sitting in the sitting room. My Aunt was part of them. It appeared that her eyes had swollen. I wondered what was going on but everyone was quiet. I greeted everyone but their responses was cold. I was on my way to the room when I heard ""Pls Don't tell her Yet"" from my Aunt Mrs (Eunice). Immediately, I rushed back to the sitting room to ask what she said they shouldn't tell me. It was at this point I got to know that I was an Orphan. My Aunt revealed to me that My mom and Dad had died in a Ghastly car accident on their way from one party they went to. This news weakened me. I sat on the floor that day wailing and rolling on the floor. But it was the little I could do. They are gone forever. That day was the saddest day of my life apart from the First Day my Uncle rap€d me. Everyone soon moved on with life. I was to remain with Rachael and my Uncle while My 3 siblings moved to My Aunt's House to continue their Education. She has promised to be a father and mother to us all whenever we need help. It was barely 2 months after my parents death when my Uncle started again. He was a shameless man. He knew I wasn't going to resist him. He knew my weakness and he was using it to his own advantage. As usual, we had sex that day. So it continued because at this point I lost all hope. My parents her gone. I felt empty and weak. Two weeks later, I fell ill. Vomiting and running temperature. I was taken to our usual family hospital where it was discovered that I was Pregnant again for the second time. They (He and his doctor) gave me a pill to take that night. While all these what's happening, Rachael wasn't aware. My Uncle lied to her that I had malaria and that I was going to be fine. I thought I was going to be fine but no I was wrong. The symptoms still persisted. He took me back to the hospital and the doctor confirmed that The foetus/baby has grown beyond what he could Terminate. Which means all the pills he gave me Didn't work. All this point, I prayed for the earth to swallow me. I was ashamed of myself. The reason is that I don't know who was responsible for the pregnancy between Sola my boyfriend and My Uncle because they both had s€x with me during the same period. So I was devastated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""Before today, I had been reliably informed of the plan to attack the Speaker based on the decision of the House concerning the nominees of the Governor, particularly the rejected ones,"" Dr. Obasa said during plenary adding that he had been inundated with calls from people and members of the House. The Speaker stressed that the House does not have any fight with Sanwo-Olu or the executive arm as projected by some people, who may not be aware of the actual reasons for the rejection of the nominees. ""There is this erroneous belief that we are waging war against the Governor. There is no basis for me and the House to fight the Governor. I will continue to say that the Governor is a brother and colleague in the Lagos project and service to the people of our State. ""The Governor and I have been around in the system for long. While he was SA to the former Deputy Governor, Femi Pedro, I was in this House as chairman, Committee on Rural Development. He was SA on Establishment and Pensions and I was chairman, House Committee on Public Accounts (Local Governments). While he was heading LSDPC, I was chairman, Committee on Economic Planning and Budget. Then, I became the Speaker and when he became the Governor, I remained the Speaker. So it's been a long journey together. ""But I wonder why anytime the House says no to a particular request of the Governor, it is taken by some people to mean there is a fight with the Governor. This House has passed so many resolutions that the executive arm refused to carry out, but people don't see that as something to talk about and the House does not raise eyebrows. So I don't know what brings the erroneous belief that the House is fighting the Governor, who is our brother and who we will continue to work with. ""However, we have a constitutional responsibility. Just as the Governor has the responsibility to inform the House about his nominees, the House has the responsibility to say 'yes' or 'no' which we have exercised by confirming some and denying some and we have our reasons for saying 'no' to some of the nominees. ""The House, as a body, has refrained itself from exposing what it discovered during the screening exercise and we are not going to be forced to spill to the public,"" Dr. Obasa said. Concerning the rejection of Prof. Akin Ababyomi, former health commissioner, Obasa said considerations went beyond his efforts in the fight against COVID-19 which he described as an isolated issue in the challenged health sector of the State. ""Before Prof. Abayomi, there were Leke Pitan, Dr. Jide Idris and others. COVID-19 was an isolated case that was considered. Before COVID-19, we had Ebola which was also taken care of under Babatunde Fashola. ""Beyond all these, we are the representatives of the people, their mouthpieces, eyes and ears. The health sector of Lagos is not just about COVID-19. We have general hospitals and other health care centres around the State. What can be said about them? ""Before Engineer Aramide Adeyoye, we also had Engineer Ganiyu Johnson and Dr. Obafemi Hamzat as Commissioner for Works and under whom the Ikoyi-Victoria Island link bridge was built while Babatunde Fashola was Governor. Under Asiwaju Bola Tinubu as Governor, there was masaive infrastructural development too. ""So we must stop making allusions concerning somethings we do not understand. They mentioned the former Commissioner for Information, Gbenga Omotoso and his experience. But how about actions in office?"" Obasa asked. The Speaker added that as a politician whose party is in power, the priority of those in government should be the interest of the people. He urged those planning to sponsor actions against the House to realise that protests and sponsored articles would not make the House rescind its decision. ""The civil society that is threatening to protest should do so because it is a constitutional right. But we are not going to be threatened or intimidated. We have said no, but if there is a convincing or germane reason for us to reverse our decision, we (truncated) | Photos from Lagos Monitoring Team's post",,"['ebola', 'covid-19']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Hausa people say that knowledge of work reduces difficulty, i.e. anyone who knows how to work and how to manage the work, then the difficulty he will suffer in managing the work is not as much as someone who does not have experience.

It's been a beautiful ride as I pen down my experience travelling back to my homeland after ages. Let me at least read what my Dellycious are saying regarding my Chronicles... Paused writing, grabbed a glass of water and boom! Comment section and it Gurus! 😅 A handful of positive comments which got me encouraged to write more and of course, those of the other side... ""Black leg, Chuckskin, Showshow, Oversabi, Liar, Fabricated stories, Clamouring for a Presidential appointment blablabla MY BIG LAUGH! 😅 Those adjectives are stale. Get some new ones already! I however, read the HONEST and POLITE concerns raised by some of you and I think it's only fair to pause and respond according. 1. ""Mummy Delly, I bribed 15k at the airport before I could be released to catch my flight"". Me: Bro, did you have your yellow fever vaccination card? 🤔 Understand, that is a REQUIREMENT for travelling. In fact, before travelling, I was made to understand, that is one of the main documents I will be needing. I had my YFC from the last time I travelled and since it only expires after 10years, I had no need procuring one. I only needed one for my son and since my son has some medical challenges, it was a walk-to-the-park getting one for him. Understand, Yellow fever, Malaria, Typhoid, Diphtheria, Hepatitis A & B etc are most prevalent in Cameroon and getting vacationated for YELLOW FEVER is a PREREQUISITE for travelling into and from Cameroon. Covid was but has recently been scrapped out by the ministry of Public health. Meaning, if you cannot present your YFC, you will have to pay or you don't travel! Now tell me, whose fault is that? 🤔 2. ""Mummy Delly, I paid 20k for my luggages to be wrapped with foil. Isn't that bribery?"" Me: Weighing and foiling of your bags are UNOFFICIAL extra service you paid for. This has nothing to do with the official travel requirements. Meaning, that's someone's job (black colar) and you HAD TO PAY for his services. Wait, who should foil your bags for you? Besides, it was optional. You could have said ""NO, I don't need my bags foiled"" and he wouldn't insist. But hey, there would have been repercussions. Your bags would either been rejected at check-in or you risk spilling/destroying your content. Whose fault is that dear? 🤔 3. ""Mummy Delly, I took forever for my passport/ID CARD to be issued"". Me: Concerning Passports, when exactly was that? It is common knowledge that the passport department in Cameroon was run by a cartel and fortunately, the government stepped in and has since made it a safe haven. When last did you apply for a passport? 🤔 One another thought and regarding IDs, I made mine in 2014, just before I travelled back to the UK. I've since then not been required to do another as it takes 10years to expire. So, I haven't faced any of such stress. However, be honest with yourself... Were your documents OK? Like do you have the right birth certificate? Have you ever been known by other names or ever changed your date of birth? Did you go through the right source or you used an agent? Viola! 🤷🏾‍♀️ Not that the process is meant to be long for whatever reason, I'm just saying, these could be one of the reasons why your ID/Passport is taking forever and fingers crossed, something is done to salvage the situation in the nearest future. 4: ""Mummy Delly, your son is British and you're a Public figure that's why you had such privileges. Me: My Big laugh! Far from that! I left the UK and was INTENTIONAL about my appearance. I knew I'd be meeting with my Fans and I wanted to appear very RELATABLE. I guess I succeeded in that as there was nothing about me depicting a Public Figure or riches. I met with Francophone staffs who barely even know me. Besides, the privileges of DELLY - THE PUBLIC FIGURE only started outside the airport and if you've noticed, I've only penned down my experiences from London to Nsimalen Airport and nothing further. And NO! My son being British was rather one of the reasons I spent more hours than needed at the airport as more FORMALITIES had to be carried out. 5: ""You're just doing this for attention"" Me: (Sipping some water), You are absolutely CORRECT! I'm glad, I got your attention afterall and you're reading. 😊 I'll respond to more concerns as we journey along. I know most of you can't wait for the downsides. Patience is a VIRTUE! 😊 CAMEROON IS NOT AS BAD AFTERALL! #ReceiveSense #IntentionalLiving",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ffacd2f9-e856-436d-9894-af3bcab0dc9f,needsReview,"PRESS RELEASE ON THE JOINT GOVERNMENT CONFERENCE ON THE EXPENSE OF LIFE IN CAMEROON FOLLOWING THE RUSSIAN-UKRAINIAN CONFLICT. On August 10, 2023, five Cameroonian ministers held a joint press conference to make public government measures to combat the high cost of living due to the so-called Russian-Ukrainian crisis for our country. On this occasion, the government spokesperson, Minister René Emmanuel SADI, made an introductory statement presenting the quintessence of the “efforts” made by the power in place. The Movement for the Renaissance of Cameroon (MRC) notes to denounce that the introductory statement in question, by a sleight of hand, presents the collective budget resulting from the order of June 2, 2022 supplementing certain provisions of the finance law of the 2022 financial year by the Head of State as a subsidy of petroleum products when it was more effectively a question of taking into account the increase in oil revenues due to the explosion in the price of crude on the international market, following the Russian-Ukrainian conflict. Thus, the increase in the so-called subsidy which would go from 120 to 480 billion, or an increase of 360 billion CFA francs, rather reflects revenues collected by the State which could have induced a drop in the prices of various petroleum products at the pump, especially since it largely covered the reduction in taxable values applicable to imports of refined petroleum products decided in the finance law. In addition to hydrocarbons, the introductory remarks highlight the emphasis placed on essential products for which the State devotes efforts through exemptions and tax and customs reductions. These measures are taken for the exclusive benefit of importers without any impact on citizens as current prices on the markets are not impacted by them. Freezing the prices of basic necessities, after having brought them back to official levels approved by the State, is a more effective instrument in such a situation, which directly impacts the household basket. If the Chamber of Auditors opens an investigation today into the companies awarded the measures taken for the importation of basic necessities, it is almost obvious that, as in the case of the Covid-19 markets, these are the members of the government and their cronies who will be reaping all the benefits. The mention of maintaining the prices of a kilowatt of electricity and a cubic meter of water unchanged for households raises questions about the influence of Russia or Ukraine in the production of these two resources in Cameroon. . Is the government's primary role to raise prices so that when it abstains for a moment we should applaud it? When he talks about the structural measures to be implemented to contain or mitigate possible shocks, the government spokesperson's remarks are at once vague, elusive and vague, without any concrete proposals. However, the high cost of living is a palpable reality that breaks many Cameroonians on a daily basis and which, well beyond the Russian-Ukrainian crisis, highlights the resignation of the government in its missions to support citizens. Indeed, it is at least since October 2021, four months before the outbreak of the crisis in Eastern Europe, that Cameroonians have decried the growing phenomenon of the high cost of living in our country, without provoking the appropriate reaction. leaders. Do price controls still exist in our country? Because he refers to other countries in his opening remarks, it is good to remind the government spokesperson that Côte d'Ivoire has frozen prices on its market, that salaries have been increased there to compensate for the inflation and give purchasing power to populations and that the private sector benefits from support measures to continue to satisfy demand on the markets. This is one example among others. It is therefore clear that Cameroonian citizens are the ones left behind by government measures to combat the high cost of living. Since in the end, the prices of products will remain out of their reach, their purchasing power weak, while a privileged few and those related to the government will benefit from the state measures decided in this context as always.

THIS IS NOT A TEMPORAL MINISTRY, THIS MINISTRY IS A TRANSGENERATIONAL MINISTRY. YOU CAN’T TRIUMPH IN THE KINGDOM BY TRICKS. IF IT EVER HAPPENS IT IS JUST FOR A SHORT WHILE. WALKING IN THE TRUTH CAUSES A BELIEVER TO TRIUMPH ALWAYS IN EVERY PLACE NEVER THINK THAT EVERYBODY IS HAPPY WITH US IN THIS MINISTRY. WE HAVE SO MANY ENEMIES, WE ARE BLESSED WITH THEM BUT WHEN YOUR WAYS PLEASE THE LORD HE MAKES YOUR ENEMIES TO BE AT PEACE WITH YOU What is it that secures open doors in a world of darkness? Access to light and walking in that light. You can’t be walking in the light and you have a barrier installed by darkness on your path. It clears the way. No economic situation in any land can stop the covenant of abundance from working. You are walking in the light of the covenant of abundance, the horror of darkness starts clearing the way for you. The unusual starts happening in your life. You are not down because the world is down, you are down because you don’t have the light that keeps us up in a world of darkness. Church Gist. COVID-19 went wild slaying people at will but he kept us here. When light showed up in the prison, every man’s bond was loosed. The foundation of the prison was shaken and all the doors opened. As light broke forth darkness gave way. From this day as you choose to walk in the light of God’s Word concerning every area of your life, no door shall succeed to be shut against you. The good news is that whatever door Jesus opens no devil can shut. Revelation 3:7-8. Never think that everybody is happy with us in this ministry. We have so many enemies, we are blessed with them but when your ways please the Lord He makes your enemies to be at peace with you. God will judge someday. He is already judging now. You can’t triumph in the Kingdom by tricks. If it ever happens it is just for a short while. Church Gist. Walking in the truth causes a believer to triumph always in every place. 2 Corinthians 2:14. You are not in a temporal ministry, this ministry is a transgenerational ministry. If Jesus took 2,000 more years to come, this Church will be there in power, authority, in glory with signs and wonders erupting from generation to generation. The master key to a world of open doors is our love. His presence will open any door no matter who shut it. He that walks in love dwells in God and God in him. 1 John 4:16-18. You can’t stop his way forward, God’s presence makes that impossible. No council of witches can stop the way of a man that carries God’s presence. As we grow in love the Bible says we step into the realm of the fullness of His presence. Ephesians 3:17-19. As you grow in love, you are being filled with His fullness from one realm to another. So your appearance equals His appearance because you dwell in Him and He in you. So the gates don’t lift their heads for you, they lift their heads for Him. What that means is stay in love with God and no door will ever be shut against you. Stay in love with God. Not theoretical love or in words and tongue but in truth and deed. Church Gist. Stay in love in truth and indeed, it is the master key to a world of open doors. You carry His presence visibly and every door opens to you on their own accord. John 21:15-17. It is not I love you. John 14:21. I will show up wherever he is and everybody will know he carries my presence. Matthew 28:20. Being on my mission, you can’t miss me. Don’t sit down for changes to come, seek for what brings changes. Do you know why God is domiciled in our midst? We are constantly in pursuit of His pursuit. Constantly, untiringly. Mark 16:20. When He sends, He goes with the sent. When He leads, He goes with the led. That is the way it works. Church Gist. When God goes with you, every barrier must clear the way. Isaiah 45:1-3. 'If you let me lead you, I will subdue nations before you plus their gods.' He goes with you to shatter the barriers. In the precious name of Jesus, no one here will suffer the torment of the wicked anymore. 1 John 4:18. Perfect love secures for you and me the fullness of His presence. You can’t have God with you and be afraid of devils. Your days of fear and terror are finally over. - Bishop David Oyedepo on UNDERSTANDING THE WONDERS OF DIVINE DIRECTION 1 at Covenant Day of Open Doors Service || Faith Tabernacle, Canaanland|| First Sunday Service || Read the full message here: #BishopDavidOyedepo #CovenantDayofOpenDoorsService #FaithTabernacle #SupersonicSunday #LFCWorldwide #OnCovenantHighways #3rdSeptember2023 #ChurchGist | Photos from Church Gist's post",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Away from that, the training came and after the class some of the students came to me that they would want to go into full time production of curry powder and Jollof Rice spice, well I encouraged them and prayed they do well some of them had to register their business names which I was glad they did. So 3 years after this training I have gotten calls from some of them and their achievements and one of them that called blew me up with how much work she has put into herself and how fast she has grown. Last week Mrs. Nelly walked into my office with some smiles on her face as she shared her experience with me in ontisha Anambra State, Nelly said that she called for a Spice production training and over 70 persons were in attendance for the Spice import business mentorship class where all attendees paid a seed capital of 30,000 and the training lasted for 3 hours, I believed her because I have been there before now and I know she can pull that with her strengths and passion for the business. I promise her I am going to share this because I know someone here will be the next to make some more millions if only you can put in 20% work in whatever you find yourself doing.

That was how my heart started beating fast anyhow. I started browsing the numbers of the people that will come and carry me to isolation center for treatment before its too late. Chai, I have left Ibadan to Lagos to catch Ebola o, could this be the end? I was restless as I move around the house.

Most of these issues are similar to HIV which are seen as positive results after it didn't exist before marriage. demons are a major factor of seeding mistrust in some cases. And women, you should keep an eye on your husband's mouth. If you notice that he starts behaving in ways that are not his character, you lying men tell his parents and your parents because witchcraft is common. Don't say that you will turn around and be patient with Fate, sometimes the problem is not patience with fate, you have to be patient with the evil that someone is planning. You want to find a solution as soon as possible, otherwise, things will always get worse, and the divorce will come. The reason why I spoke for knowledge is that there is no one to tell you that things are happening because you live with them, David's, so you have to look at the signs that your mind tells you, and this sense of understanding cannot be found except religious knowledge. Therefore, it is important to be persistent in seeking religious knowledge because it is the cure for the evil that the wicked are preparing for us. And by God, these bad guys don't sleep. they are always in preparation. That is why we must pray every day and not rob and look for a solution if we recognize that there is a problem that is not a natural problem. Nobody is safe, especially if you have something in your hand, just a little bit of it. We will protect ourselves, no one knows what someone is going through without disclosure, but seeking protection through prayer is a must. By God, we have not seen her sleep in the present era.

The $5,000 charge is equivalent to N4 million. But in some cases, it can be subsidised at $4,500, which is about N3.5 million.

This was an opportunity to share key messages on the modes of transmission and prevention of the Anthrax disease. Here are nine ways to prevent Anthrax. a. Vaccination is the most effective preventive measure against Anthrax in livestock. Consult a veterinarian to develop a vaccination schedule suitable for your livestock. b. Antibiotics medication and Anthrax vaccination cannot work together. Animals cannot receive antibiotics treatment two weeks before or after vaccination. c. Use personal protective equipment (gloves, facemasks, goggles, boots) when handling sick animals. d. Regularly monitor livestock for any sign of sickness or unusual behavior. e. Immediately report cases of animals bleeding from body openings to veterinary authorities or agriculture extension workers. f. Do not process or move dead or sick animals. Quickly report to your veterinary doctor or authorities at the Ministry of Agriculture in your State. g. Maintain good hygiene practices on the farm through regular cleaning and disinfection of animal housing, feeding equipment, and water troughs. h. Ensure a clean and safe water supply for livestock and avoid using water from stagnant sources. i.

Dr. Fanaka says the figure represents a vaccination of about 96 percent.
He however explained that the health office reported a total of 68 refusals from community members adding that these were mainly due to various religious beliefs.
He further revealed that Chipata District reported the highest with a total of 138,998 children who were vaccinated during the campaign, thereby attributing the development to the district’s high population.

f4f991e6-6685-4c62-80b5-d4d226cbad24,archived,"🔔 An internship must be a real first step. 📢 When I decided to stop my physics degree in 2019 at Gamal Abdel Nasser University in Conakry, I had a lot of plans. But the plan that I really followed was to do a training course. 🔶️ In my head, the objective was clear: to introduce myself to coding, and particularly to programming, a tool that I found essential for a future professional in the field of electronic innovation. 🌟 I had read that you have to learn to communicate with computers, mainly through the C++ programming language. 🔶️ It was during the #DevFest2019 organized by GDG RATOMA that I met the man who will very quickly be my manager. Very quickly after explaining my project to him, he offered to offer me a learning framework and mentoring to support my development of skills. 🔶️ Instead of going towards C++, I started with HTML & CSS. Then, I moved on to JavaScript before learning Python during a #MeetUp. I followed tutorials and received advice from seniors. 🔶️ At the same time, I had the responsibility of doing what I had already been doing since 2017: posting on social media. But this time, on behalf of the company, as a community manager. I improved over time and developed additional skills thanks to this position. ✅ During this adventure, I learned a lot of things apart from what was very useful and relevant. This includes general culture, scientific knowledge and skills that are useful and profitable for any business. ✅ During this internship, I mainly discovered corporate culture, the corporate journal, and task lists. I sometimes took care of drafting administrative documents and accompanied the team to prospect in the field. This is great luck 🍀! 💡 When I stopped the internship in March 2020, in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic, and then launched @ABBA Business Brokerage, my first business, I had already learned in 6 months the equivalent of several years at university. (No kidding 🤷🏿‍♂️) 🔶 What I would especially like to share is the role that this internship played in the development of my skills, my knowledge and my understanding of the professional environment. It was very enriching because the company had implemented a continuous learning process and I was eager to learn. 🌟 This means that if you are looking for a great internship experience, you need a company that is willing to offer it to you. But this business will also need you to give back, by producing results. And it’s only by fully investing in it that you will succeed! ‼️Any internship must be preceded by one or more defined learning objectives and perhaps even by KPIs which allow you to check your progress in relation to your objectives. ⚠️ The objective of an internship is not to occupy yourself to pass the time or to obtain bonuses. It’s more about taking a first step in a field. ✅ It's acquiring knowledge, skills and experience that will allow you to get closer to your professional goals or to start a professional adventure. ✖ And above all, I think there is no point in doing a one-year internship in a company or doing several internships in a row. I think if someone does that, it’s a sign that they don’t have goals or aren’t achieving them. 🎯 So, dear internship candidates, don't waste your time in a company that doesn't allow you to take the first step or that prevents you from taking the second step. 🚀 Have the audacity to leave when there are no results and have the courage to invest yourself so that there are results. #LearnAndShare #Mindset #TheCallOfDuty #Internship #Internship #Guinea #Africa #Youth #Opportunity #EmergingLeader",,['covid-19'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This young MP made an impression on me with his eloquence and his very intelligent and pragmatic outspokenness. I really liked these interventions and the good thing is that I recognized his name. I could look him up on Facebook why not I would like to congratulate him. Nowadays, our deputies are very strict, others don't even know what they are doing in the general assembly, it's terrible eh. Here's a little guy who takes the microphone and says sensible things, but I really liked it. I click on my search bar and type his name hoping to find it ''Henry Mongo''. Hmm there are many who use this name I try to look profile by profile and up I come across him. Wow, I'm lucky. Well didon he is hiding far away here you have to have tact to find him among all these profiles. So what do I do? Should I leave a message or send an invitation request? Hummm well I'll leave a message because I'm sure he has tons of invitation requests and it's not me he's going to notice. My message: hello honorable. Allow me to write to you, it was stronger than me. I was not aware of your existence until I came across a televised debate last Sunday where you were among the panelists.

Nigerian Wife Cries Out I have been feeling like my husband has been cheating on me with our neighbors daughter. She is just about 23 years. Yesterday which was Sunday, I went to our neighbors house around 6pm to ask if I could use their oven. Their compound is not fenced so I just walked in straight to their backyard if I would see the man's wife. I overheard this girl making a call. Apparently she was the only one at home and she wasn't expecting anyone. She was asking the man over the fone who was sexualy better between his wife and her. My attention was arrested immediately. I stopped to hear more of the conversation. When I had enough, I made my presence known. She quickly hung up and tried to put up an innocent face. I also pretended like I heard nothing, I asked to use the oven and left . Getting back home, I was worried if that was my husband that girl was talking to, so I decided to find out. I got my husbands fone later that night and went through the call log. The time that girl was making that call was few minutes past 6. I checked my husbands fone and there was a number he called around that time. The number was not saved on the fone so I decided to call that number on my own fone and my true caller identified the number as ""Vicky hookup"". Guess what, the girls name is Victoria. I was surprised because I have the girls number saved on my fone. But I guess the number I have is for her family and friends. The one my husband has is for clients. I opened his WhatsApp and found no chat with the girl, so I decided to check his telegram. ( Normally I don't like telegram so I never open it on either my fone or husband's) My husbands telegram was locked. I was surprised cos that is the only app locked on his fone. To cut the long story short, I found a way to open the app, and I saw his chat with that girl. It pains me to say that my husband has been having sex with that girl without protection.

This can happen through sex, which is the result of sexual intercourse. This way, when a person meets the family, the disease is found for some species but not for everyone. A woman or a man, if one of them is carrying this disease, he can get this disease during intercourse. There are different types and causes of liver cancer, but the symptoms can be the same but the bacteria can be different, which are divided into 5. Hepatitis that is classified as Hepatitis includes hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E. *Different viruses are responsible for causing different types of hepatitis. * 5 types of Liver Disease. *HEPATITIS A -Hepatitis A is caused by infection with the hepatitis A virus (HAV). This type of hepatitis is most commonly spread by eating food or water contaminated with feces from someone infected with hepatitis A. *HEPATITIS B -Hepatitis B is spread through contact with infectious fluids, such as blood. , vaginal secretions, or semen containing hepatitis B virus (HBV). Injecting drug use, having sex with an infected partner, or sharing razors with an infected person increases the risk of contracting hepatitis B. *HEPATITIS C -Hepatitis C comes from hepatitis C virus (HCV ). Hepatitis C is spread through direct contact with infected body fluids, usually through the use of needles and sexual contact. *HEPATITIS D - Hepatitis D, also known as delta hepatitis, hepatitis D is a serious liver disease caused by the hepatitis D virus (HDV). HDV is transmitted through direct contact with infected blood. *HEPATITIS E - Hepatitis E is a disease caused by the hepatitis virus (HEV).

As soon as it was 8:30pm, I left the house using a Bolt to avoid being tracked or spotted. When I arrived at the address, someone took me to a secret room and there I found other women. When I took a closer look at their faces, I discovered they were my husband's business partners' wives. As soon as it was 9pm, the meeting commenced and the head woman made her complaint of how she could no longer endure having miscarriages for her husband to get wealthy.*stolen from missing pen* Other women all applauded her, because they too were tired of having to abort their babies for the sake of their husband's wealth. After a lot of discussion, it was discussed that we should all go home and figure out our husbands' weaknesses then use it to set ourselves free. Everyone went home satisfied, but unfortunately one of the ladies who didn't support what we said went and reported the whole thing to her husband. Sooner or later, all of our men got to hear it and one by one we all were killed. I was lucky to hear of how my co-wives were killed and before the return of my husband, I ran to my sister's place for safety. Two weeks over my sister's place, I began developing symptoms of malaria and was rushed to the hospital for a test. According to the doctor, I was pregnant. As soon as I got that pregnancy, I began to have bad dreams and threats. I refused to give in, no matter how many threats I received in my dreams. Not long enough, it was nine months and I had a safe delivery. All of this was kept out of the hearing of my husband. One day while I was in the market buying some food items, I stumbled upon my husband.*stolen from missing pen* He immediately chased me down to my house, but when he saw my baby, he screamed fire and ran back. After that, some assassins attempted to attack us, but we were luckily saved by a military man. After that day, I left my sister's place and hooked up with a friend. During my stay there, a call came in from my husband's second wife. She was saying that she had found out his weakness and I was the only person who could stop him. She seriously begged me to help her. According to her, if my husband could set his eyes on his child again, he would lose his righteousness before his god. *Stolen from missing pen*I knew that I had to do anything to bring my husband down, so I and Helen (hubby's new wife) planned to show him the child by 8pm the next day, when hubby would be resting in the parlour. Because of lack of trust, I added some police officers around and when I showed hubby the child, he immediately dived to attack the baby, but one of the police officers shot him in the leg. Right away, he was arrested alongside Helen. After interrogation, it turned out that Helen was in the same cult group with hubby.

5956d328-c6e4-40fd-88b6-ac7856a3ef50,archived,"EVERYTHING IS BLESSED! : Nevertheless, more and more men and women believed in the Lord and were added to their number. As a result, people brought the sick into the streets and laid them on beds and mats so that at least Peter’s shadow might fall on some of them as he passed by. Acts 5:14-15 NIV “ When God blesses you, He blesses everything that’s connected to you, be it your money, clothes, books, etc.; they become items, channels, and conduits of blessings. Think about that! We read how handkerchiefs and aprons taken from Paul’s body healed the sick: “God did extraordinary miracles through Paul, so that even handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched him were taken to the sick, and their illnesses were cured and the evil spirits left them” (Acts 19:11-12 NIV). God’s power was on the handkerchiefs and aprons because they had touched Paul’s body! This first happened with the Lord Jesus. Luke 8:43-48 tells the story of the woman with the issue of blood who pushed her way through a teeming crowd to touch the hem of His garment and was healed that very moment. Jesus said power went out from Him. Also, in Luke 6, large crowds of people from all over Judea, Jerusalem and the coastal cities of Tyre and Sidon came to listen to Jesus and to be healed of their diseases, including those who were troubled by evil spirits. Luke, by the Spirit, specifically wrote, “And all the crowd sought to touch him, for power came forth from him and healed them all” (Luke 6:19 RSV). This means the blessing—the healing power—got on His clothes and was emitted to others, resulting in healing miracles. This is remarkable! It’s one of the reasons you should take good care of the things God gives you, because His power flows through them. Whether they’re your clothes, shoes, schoolbag, or even your mobile phone—everything that’s connected to you is an item of blessings. It’s got the power to attract more. Start thinking this way if you aren’t already. Everything that’s connected to you is connected to the Kingdom and blessed as a result. When you understand and are conscious of this, your life will take on a whole new meaning; the way you think, talk and walk will change. Not only that, the blessings in your life will continue to grow and impact others. *NO ONE LEFT BEHIND* *BECOME PART OF THE KINGDOM OF LIGHT, BECOME THE ANSWER TO THE PROBLEMS OF THIS WORLD TODAY.

7f822840-881c-4938-8ec3-92c1afa53f25,needsReview,"  WOP NEWS “GOOD NEWS YOU DESERVE TO KNOW” NIGHT... | WOP NEWS “GOOD NEWS YOU DESERVE TO KNOW” NIGHT OF PLENTY SERVICE 05 MARCH 2023 Tremendous delight for Plentian nation in 15th year celebration of the World of Plenty impact in people’s lives. The unique and exceptional Night of Plenty service that left people in awe at Nala Mandate Lecture theatre, 340 Magwaza Maphalala, Umbilo, Durban. His Majesty King Somnala Tehillah Song were singing different praise and worship songs and the service was marked by new songs that were composed right on stage. The nation danced and sang for the whole night, shouting, whistling and ululating as His Majesty King Somnala sang along his teachings. His Majesty King Somnala statements: World of Plenty is celebrating 15 years, it is something that has never existed and never been seen in history. In 318BC many decisions were made and the first one was for people to be told what to believe about Christ. For years westerns gathered together in discussions trying to find a way to say Jesus belongs to Trinity; that Jesus is really God. In many years to come they will be talking about us, saying we started on College Lane, in a very small road and dirty place, Rebirth Family Church. It was a blessing and a divine empowerment when the World of plenty started there. We were very few from the beginning and we were not a famous church at that time. You wouldn’t have thought something so big can start in that place. I want to encourage everyone of you here; never despise yourself just because people fail to understand you. Never doubt your abilities just because people are confused about you. When this thing started, people were having doubts and some even criticised us. We are making history with what we do and no one can write your history and speak well about your heroism except you and those who are with you. In 2007 when I was going to Pretoria, God spoke to me; He showed me farms and told me that riches are dwelling there. He asked me my parents surnames and said that it was not a coincidence that my father is Nala meaning ""abundance” and my mother is Cebekhulu, meaning “very rich”. God said to me, “Today I mandate you, go and lead people into the World of Plenty and more than enough where nothing is missing and nothing is broken”. As I shared this with people close to me; they became confused and they were having doubts. People didn’t understand when I started preaching this message for the first time at Nquthu. They couldn’t fathom it even when I came to preach the message here in Durban. Some people were asking me about the location of such a world or that place, and I loved that question because they challenged me to go back and seek answers to God. I started preaching about the land of Plenty and God began correcting me and said, “The land is a physical substance but the world is beyond the natural, it is a kosmos world system. He said, “I am telling you to lead them to the system"". For the first time he showed me the word in the bible where he promised Abraham, not because bible is the world of God but because God comes to you according to the level of your knowledge. I started searching the word ‘world’ and I found that there are three different words for world but I found out that God was talking about the kosmos world; the world with power to control on earth. He told me that the World of Plenty is not a geographic location but it is located in the supernatural where nothing is missing and nothing is broken . It is located outside of time and has it laws that do not depend on laws of this world and its equipment. In the first Lord’s Day when I started preaching about the World of Plenty, I was declaring things in my life and I told them that as from now on I will never be poor, not another day. When I made my declaration, I declared these because things were very bad on my side. I began declaring that, I will never be sick, not another day and that how we all started to live in the World of Plenty. I started making car stickers written; I live in the World of Plenty. At first some were against these stickers but slowly and surely this thing started intervening in people’s lives. People don’t know that our first World of Plenty product was a car sticker. We again started writing songs and the first song that God placed in my heart was; Ezweni leNala nangaphezu kokwanele sesiphila khona. God instructed me to make an easy song that can be sang by anyone. The song trended and it was liked and sang even by people who hated the World of Plenry. It was playing in radios all over. The World of Plenty grew and its first album was called ‘World of Plenty’. People started to speak in different languages confessing the World of Plenty. I was encouraged by one of my spiritual sons, to preach this thing up until they call me, Nala of Plenty. The World of Plenty is supernatural and is a dimension of more than enough. It is immortal, eternal and has it own resources . It can only be accessed through the right state of mind. It is a mixture of both visible and invisible. God taught me that in the spirit realm there are territories like we have regions, continents and everything here on earth; when we pass on in this life, there is another life we are going to. Just like how things are happening here on earth, so in the spirit; there is place called World of Plenty. The place is your home and has power and authority. The earth is the physical location but the world is spiritual realm where we find all spheres of power and influence. It is the place where supernatural decides what will happen in the natural. It is immortal and is more real than what we see; the spheres of no impossibilities, it is far superior than the world we know. World of Plenty is when the things I have never dreamt of are happening in my life, it is when I walk tall and I’m so sure that I’m protected. I was already 23 years in ministry as a Christian when I became a Plentian. Upon accepting my mandate, I was not perfect and I was still correcting my self. I had no revelation about the Paradigm shift. HIV was very powerful diseases and everyone was afraid of it but I stood up and declared that there is no disease that God cannot cure. 2009 I started demonstrating God’s power. I had never seen a person getting healed from HIV/AIDS but I believed that it is impossible for God to not be able to heal any diseases. I started an awareness theme mentioning that we will finish off with HIV and AIDS. When people received their healing, they said that I’m creating and giving false hope for people. When I came in that awareness service, leadership didn’t attend. It had no clarity of why God sent me, what I carry and the reason why I’m being sent. And it wasn’t a game that AIDS is going to be healed. The very first crusade started in a small place. There was a person who was fully blown to aids. There are two miracles I will never forget ; When I was declaring miracles people were receiving their healing at ground floor while I was at first floor. I saw the lame being healed for the first time in my ministry. Plentianity is yours even if you love it or hate it. His Majesty shared the story of a tiger, a donkey, and the lion echoing that you cannot argue with a fool or else you will be seen as a fool. Learn not to be fooled. When a person knows the power of the World of Plenty but still leaves, it doesn’t mean that the World of Plenty fails or is no longer there just because of their emotions. I understand, it is not easy to ignore a person when criticising you and is uttering insults but learn to keep quiet. I personally know what I was called to do and nothing can shake me. We are of peace and wisdom, be careful not to be shaken by the words from the mouth of a failure. His Majesty King Somnala complemented one of his sons; Knowledge Ngema for a remarkable marketing work done on social media . He encouraged the nation to look and lean upon what he does in his social media platforms. Mentioning that the boy is very brilliant. Knowledge Ngema looks for King Somnala’s previous teachings and testimonies to answer every question and to respond when people are insulting King Somnala. Don’t argue with a fool because people will end up not seeing the difference. His Majesty King Somnala went on to share that for the first time, that he ministered to a person and told the cancer to die, it disappeared and that is wwhen he knew that cancer listens to him. I thank God that I don’t rush to say things early. God warned me that there will come a time where He will “de-educate” me, especially the knowledge I gained from bible school; knowledge will fall out of my knees. I used to share this like a fairy tail but it has come to pass. Towards the end of 2014, people were talking saying that my picture speaks to, heals and protects them. God promised to increase my supernatural appearance to people and I started appearing all over South Africa whilst physically absent. God told me that even if there was no World of Plenty, he would have created it for me. Wop Confession: I live in the World of Plenty and more than enough where nothing is missing and nothing is broken, all is well with me. When people were testifying I first thought they were lying. God started to say that e is going to use me, mentioning that, there is a huge difference between him using me without me working for him and me now working for him. At home, I could be in the bathroom and will be healing people. People will see you as they want but I won’t be limited about you. There is so much I want to tell you, you are something that has never happened and existed. God also told me that everything written my name will heal people. In 2012 going to Nquthu when people were bringing their testimony. I asked God why people are now calling my name and things happen. When something has been said you hardly believe it when it happen. I’m teaching the things that I only take from God directly. I learn from God, I only I copy from God. I might happen to learn something from you but it is not my mandate to do things that are coming from others. When God visited me he said, the problem with people is that they preach till they die not knowing their purpose and the principle on how I operate here earth. They don’t know about the mandate but they are running with the calling. To learn what you are mandated to do you need a direct relationship with God; when you are mandated you are authorised. The miracles that are happening in Nala Mandate can be spoken for a full year in other churches. How blessed are you Plentian nation, this is the blessing that people do not believe easily even if it happens in front of them. The Impact of the World of Plenty is known by the one who sent me. When God called me I was afraid and I was beginning to be concerned; I called men of God that I trusted and asked for clarification. One thing that people leaving here mustn’t do is acting as if they are better than me. When there is pride, fall is around the corner. Nobody can have pride about something he doesn’t know how it happened; some thing that is unexplainable. As I stand before you I no longer trust a person who say is a believer, especially those believing in Christ. Thus year, God wants to prove a point for me that, what I thought is not as real as I see it. People only have a respect a person when he’s dead. I know that when I die, people will claim as if they knew and they respected me. If you can listen to people, you can think they know a person very well. I want to thank you Plentian for supporting me. I do not steal someone’s power; I compliment you when you have done something good and I say it in front if you did something bad, that I don’t like. Thank you for praying and believing World of Plenty. Some came here having only seen me in their dreams. Sometimes when you listen to World of Plenty things you feel like you are dreaming. Our mission is to help people and not only our friends. Learn from me Plentians, I have a heart of loving and forgiving others; sometimes I may enter and find people are gossiping about me but I give them my love. Wop Declaration: Plentianity is my inheritance and my way of living; the life I was given by God of Plenty. World of Plenty dream is to lead people out of the world of shortage into the World of Plenty; by reshaping their way of thinking into the philosophy of plenty, the Philosophy of abundance. The absence of money does not mean you are poor. Poverty is a condition of your mind, it is not the absence of money and materialistic things. The idea is the instrument of success and wealth. When you have an idea you will definitely succeed, you have a strategy. Money can go away for you but if you have written down your idea everything will be fine. You give birth to a child because he is already in a womb. The presence of something is not proven by seeing it. Some of you are sick and they don’t see that they are healed now. Poverty is disappearing. I don’t allow myself to worry. Sometimes for you to learn God you need to face a gruesome situations. You will never be a hero without going to the battle. You will never know the power of God residing in you if you haven’t faced powerful situations. Plentian life is proven when you have nothing to eat and you still pray, worship and thank God of Plenty. You are delaying your things when arguing because I can’t work properly. People who do not know who you are. think you are depending on money for you to be who you are, they think you need a big church to survive; and they think it is your downfall when people leave you. When I started attracting people, they were crying and looking for my help; I didn’t know them. I know my target and I don’t worry. Stick to your own label or otherwise people will despise and disrespect you if you keep arguing. A supernatural world a world of impossibilities, immortal and you will never be connected to poverty while in this World. You desires will be fulfilled even if you don’t have money. God doesn’t depend on the process of this world for you to have money. When God came to me He said, “ Nala don’t worry because my power will shut your enemies. I have experienced being left by people and they come back and say lie; they say I have fallen out of God. This mind of thinking I might fall shows me that you don’t know me. I’m not a believer because of the Bible and Christianity. God spoke and revealed himself to me without the blood of Jesus, I don’t even fit there. You are waiting for God to cleanse you with the Blood of Jesus and I don’t. The God who came and spoke the things I do now while I was still young and in no need of the blood of Jesus; Who can stop him? The things written in the bible are things that were written for a doctrine that was made by people. Canon scriptures were decided upon to their use. In 2017 while I was in a showers in God of plenty deposited the song in my heart and my mind; Angisiye owalelizwe Ngingowezwe leNala; I’m not of this world I belong to the World of Plenty. Your problem is that you want to be like them and your ears are still open to hear what they say. If there wasn’t a time where I forgot myself and did the will of God; I wouldn’t be who I am and where I am. Your problem is thinking it is over just because you have nothing in your house; you are lacking food and you have no money. You have no shortage even if you don’t have money. May the spirit of Plenty dwell and hover in your hearts. I’m here to declare the power of Plenty in your mind and In your soul. I want this to be something special in your heart and something incomparable. Just Live your life like you are crazy, do anything that comes in your mind. God is within you. God lives within you; in your heart and in your mind. Don’t wait for someone to tell you, if you feel like doing anything do it anyway. His Majesty King Somnala praying and ministering to people: I see teeth, cancer, aids problems. I open every doors that are preventing good things to happen in your life. I declare peace in your family, may you resolve every misunderstanding. The Oracle of God prayed for growth of new things. He declared new positions in work places. I declare revival in your marriages and in your work places. Sometimes we don’t care about sweating in church because that is how other people get their healing. Shaking your body heal your kidneys and your spinal cord. Everyone who came having kidneys problem and cancer are healed. King Somnala Predictions: I see 3 days and I see a person and an application. His Majesty called upon those people and among them he ministered to: Nokukhanya Mkhwanazi She applied for a position of being usher in court and His Majesty King Somnala ministered to her and prophecies her that He sees more than what she applied for. Vuyiseka Njeya She applied for a job and His Majesty King Somnala ministered to her Zinhle Dladla She applied for a job and she was given an opportunity to choose 3 days she want them to interview her with. Lucky Mfeka His Majesty prophesied that He see him working, walking down and up. Lucky confirmed that he is a chef and things are currently not working well in his job. His Majesty told him that God is moving him to another dimension hence things are not good. His Majesty King Somnala statements: When things are not going according to your plans; when they are serving you with divorce papers, when you have no money when you are having debts, sing and tell God of Plenty that you are placing all your things upon Him. When we say a Plentian doesn’t worry, we are not saying there are no challenges; however you will hear a person saying all is well with me. There is nothing I do for fun in life, being happy kills cancer and stress. 15 years just feels like it’s yesterday, its still smelling of smoke. Brand new anointing from the glory of God. King Somnala Declaration: I see the light shining all over you finances and all over your body. It is illegal for a disease to dwell in your body. There for you have the power to resist any sickness that is in your body. In the World of Plenty there is more than enough for everyone of you. There is a place for everyone of us. My mother used to say there is no place to dispose a person, we want those who were forsaken by their loved ones. When we started this thing; some said this thing will vanish into thin air and some said we will see and they still seeing us even today. When things are dark and bad, speak what you want to see. I write down everything I think; when writing down you are investing your thoughts. One day you will read and grow thoughts into something wonderful. In the world full of recession ,natural disasters, looting, war full of diseases and terrorists, belief says that the World of Plenty and its philosophy are the answers to all these tragedies. An ability to walk with eyes that see victory. An ability to think World of Plenty thoughts, endless thoughts that are not depending in this weak world. In this world where there are few Job opportunities, Plentianity faith is saying; you will receive a call for a job you have never applied for. You need the World of Plenty when you are feeling sick. Today people will receive new wombs, nothing is impossible in the World of Plenty. When they say your lung is damaged, a new one will grow. When they say your kidney is affected, let us see if they will be saying the same story. World of Plenty doesn’t depend on quantity for you to have quantity but it is quantity itself. It doesn’t depend on the riches to be rich, but it is riches itself. If you think you can find riches outside yourself you will never find them because your richness starts within. If you think you are looking for riches as a Plentian you will die depressed because you are looking for it everywhere except yourself. The World of Plenty is the ruler, authority and power that influence, control or govern the earth. The world of Plenty is in charge of the money and the healing you are looking for. Every good thing you see on earth is product of the World of Plenty. It is the world free of limitations, free of impossibilities and free from the powers of darkness. It is the world of possibilities and creative miracle, the carrier of wealthy and quantities. Every good and perfect gift are from the World of Plenty, when looking for the World of Plenty look within you. Locate the ideas God added in your heart, they are keeping on knocking to you; they come in a very persistent thought. Why you don’t take action because your job is within you mind. The problem is that you think that your thoughts are impossible. Missing an idea and failing to meditate a thought is like a womb that cannot carry and grow the seed. There are things that no body can manifest but you. The world is suffering because you are thinking what already exist, allow yourself to think the unthinkable. In science say the thought is vibration of knowledge. The power to think and do, if you can think it; that is your Indication and cues that are telling you that you can do it. If you can desire it, begin to plan, declare and shape your mind to produce. You can have the desires of your heart. What you can see with you mind eyes is a blue print. If you can desire anything you are given licence. The problem is that you want to do it with your hands first than thinking it. Writing it in a paper, have a picture and call it. It is coming to you. The small idea can open great things. I’m fixing your throat now. When I started consultations I thought I would only see 5 people and when I came there were already 15 people. I recently started what we call Face-to-face Prophetic Consultation, something told me to call them on Thursday and I had doubts. I wonder where would I be had I listened to something that said who will come. Just do it as you think and feel. These are the thoughts of the World of Plenty. Your life can change like that. Just do it. I have created my own library in my phone of all my teachings thus far. World of Plenty impact Impact- To be heard, when cars collides they make an impact and that is how I think about the World of Plenty. Plentianity is here to stay, it is not going anywhere. If you want to be tormented for your whole life be against Plentianity. When you think you can go against Plentianity you will see yourself defeated everyday. World of plenty might have came with a person but it is not a person. World of Plenty has delivered us from the bible which is manual book from human control and menticide. The bible is a manual book for controlling human mind and their ways of thinking. We were told the bible is the word of God and we must accept it and not question. We are programmed to think everything about the bible is true and everything else is a lie. They will think you’re a devil when you speak against the bible. The Word Menticide It is a Latin name Mind or Mentalist ,mental, cida killer by analogy to homicide, genocide. They came to kill your mind. The bible was written about 100BC and Abraham was long gone by that time. How can Moses tells us something that happened thousand years before je was born; four generations from God to Moses. Moses had an ability to pray in a mountain 40 days without eating and drinking. Religion can tie your mind and once you start to think you are devil. It’s built upon fear. Menticide: It was brought to brainwash, Conditioning people to abandon their beliefs. According to us it is witchcraft go kill the your child or your sibling for the blood. Christianity legalised crime; you cannot drink somebody’s blood and eat somebody’s body and think things are going to be well in your life. We have never spoke to the dead in their tombs. We have never sacrificed for the dead. We have never offered to the dead and we learnt all that from church. It was their efforts to destroy the mind or the will of an individual or group of people. There are two things that are holding Africans back; Christianity and our traditions. Genesis 28 vs 01 Anthropomofic people bring their ideas, explaining God as a human. A person can take a stone and speak to it like God. Many people treat God like a human and that is a problem and That’s why they think He competes with us. Imagine a God who created a person who is evil and he comes to a point where He regrets making him. One day you will realise that the God you were told in the bible is not a real God , it is because you were menticide, your mind is dead. You can even insult your real God for God you don’t know. Imagine God releasing his angels and he doesn’t see that they will sleep with his people on earth. Where is difference between us and God of the bible. If I look at the God of the bible I think I’m better than him because I warn you when seeing something that is going to happen, the storms. When your mind is killed you will love your slave master and those making you slave. God who appeared to Abraham as a human and he was hungry and required Abraham to slaughter a animal for him to eat. They killed you when they said what you do for you late grandfather is for a demon. Meaning when I die and come in your dreams showing you a things you will say I’m demon. Religion lock your mind and declare it your enemy, you are busy fighting yourself. You are busy looking for an angel and Jesus you will never met. Look at how the mind of people have developed. Africans must unite if we are going to fight. We will never conquer while our lives are regulated by the bible from our oppressors. The people who did this 500 years, they stole and studied the Bible. The concept that took a decision that the bible need to be preach was not from God. Jews know that Jesus is not theirs. Skariots were rebels not necessarily that Jesus was sold by Jews. It is a scam made by people. The reason why you are thinking we are fools Is because you think you can not perform something better. Roman Catholic wanted to rule the world. One day I will tell you who is Christ and that you were manipulated. What Important is that when I preached Jesus I was convinced when I was a child I acted as a child but when I grew up I began thinking and doing things like elders. Bible is a book of greatest stories but never a real story or history. The bible was not meant to be taken literally. The day you here a person saying they know who started was the first to live on earth , just know that it’s a lie. How can you light for your ancestors when they are the ones powerful and near God; How can you trust them. No one can tell me what to do for my late mom. The only thing I can do is when a person come and tell me to go somewhere and dig millions. If I can find them than I can slaughter as many cattle as she/he wants. Imagine your ancestor will give you a lucky to go and work under people who came stole their land and oppressed them. Why don’t they give us the power to be greater than white people. When coming to me you are coming to see me at your own sake if you don’t win, I’m not involved because you are paying for my time. Be wise, go look for a job when you have a calling. Start a business to provide for your children because there is no money in church. Let wake up, how does someone steal from you and you expect them to give you laws of justice how to run our world. Nothing killed people like BEE. The world is not controlled by democracy but minority. There are two things I hate with my life; Christianity and Democracy. If there was no bible there would be no enslaving of black people. It something that was made for you to think you are nothing. One thing that will kill you is thinking there is a traditionalist that will bring all your ancestors back home. My ancestors are my parents and the grandparents I only know. My religion is how my dad raised me and I have my own religion now. You are who you are today because of your parents. You are laying a foundation for your children in whatever you do. We are to blame for our children future. Black people like to show off. Learn to be smart. The only thing you know is saying people are practising sacrifices and cults when they are having money. Not even traditional medicine will save you when you use your money recklessly. We used to not eat meat everyday but also vegetables and that is why our elders lived long and people are having gout today. Go and plant your vegetables at home, if you have a space. Go and study, Google everything I teach you; do not just take it as it is . According to our African history, a woman is older than a man. Today they tell us that women minds are high and you receive your intelligence more from your mother than your father. Women you will now be free from the oppression that is written in the bible. Women you are menticide to a point that you don’t see that man that loves you for real when he doesn’t have money. We have never competed with our sisters and wives for authorities before westerns came. In the knowledge I have today, I have gained 80% knowledge from women and I have grown to respect a woman. A woman can forget herself to help you even if she doesn’t feel like doing so. There is a difference when a man beats you. I urge you woman learn to respect and support each other. Learn to give other people a chance, especially when she is trying to start something because everyone is not perfect. You can never hear a person’s without listening, analysing and observing her. Sometimes what heals a person is lending the your ear. Only observe to help and not to be a judge. Learn to understand each other. The reason why people fight when pregnant is that you are carrying another person. Never leave each other in a relationship during pregnancy. In some of the things you just have to count, keep quiet and move on. Somethings need to be left as they are no one is perfect.2023- A YEAR OF PLENTIAN ARISTOCRATIC LIFESTYLE",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dfdf66ac-f8ff-47b9-8b38-f8b0017531d0,needsReview,"Thousands access City’s HIV prevention strategy... | Thousands access City’s HIV prevention strategy.

Less than 18 months after the launch of a new HIV preventative strategy at a number of City of Cape Town clinics, Pre Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) has been accessed by more than 6 000 clients.

PrEP is a daily tablet of anti-retrovirals which will prevent a HIV-negative person from contracting HIV and is used when you are at risk of being exposed to HIV through sexual activity.

‘South Africa is the first country in Africa to approve PrEP and since its launch at our clinics in February last year, 6 184 clinic clients have received it.

‘Although HIV has become a manageable chronic health condition, there is no cure and it still impacts lives. When you’re sexually active the onus is on you to ensure you remain healthy and protect yourself from becoming infected with a sexually transmitted infection (STI), and at the same time, you are protecting your partner,’ said Mayoral Committee Member for Community Services and Health, Councillor Patricia van der Ross.

HIV is also defined as an STI, as it is mostly transmitted sexually. 

PrEP does not protect against other STIs, only HIV, as it blocks the replication of the virus in human cells and thereby stopping infection. It also does not prevent pregnancy. 

Condoms continue to play an important role in preventing other STIs and in preventing unplanned pregnancies.

‘PrEP is highly effective for preventing HIV when it’s taken as prescribed. STIs and their devastating effects can be prevented. The staff at our clinics are able to address any concerns or questions so you can do what is best to safeguard your own sexual health and your future,’ said Councillor Van der Ross.

fe7a6f7f-ead5-4de4-b3a6-43c7da22d5e4,archived,"ALIYU NAMANGI ZARIA SONGWRITER i was the leading poet of the Hausa in the mid-20th century. Born in 1895, within his first year he lost his sight through an attack of measles and smallpox. Despite this, he became a Malam (a Hausa expression loaned from the Arabic word ‘Mu’alim’ that means ‘teacher’) learning by heart the texts required to become an Islamic scholar. Like other Hausa poets, Aliyu developed his style through live performances to groups of the pious. Whilst the poems deal with Muslim religious themes such as praising the Prophet, Aliyu’s vocabulary and style also embraces the humour and wit that is traditional of Hausa oral poetry. We give thanks to the Lord of the Worlds for the bounty bestowed on us in no small measure. We rejoice in the rule of the English, for since they came our country has not known poverty; For in their time we have been brought paper money, which does not weigh down the pocket. So too through their kindness we have received the aeroplane, so that you go to Mecca without trouble. Then there are motor-cycles, cars and the rest, which in the old days were unknown to us. If you have to travel, look for a lorry if you don’t coincide with a railway. But if there’s neither train nor motor, then go on your feet and not on a shameless bicycle. Just leave the bicycle to me! You wicked trouble-maker, you! Thing not fit for an adult to ride! It was at Dan Mahawayi that I got on, (1) but it left me at Tudun Yakaji and I never reached town. It left me sore all over, sitting on the road, and afterwards the Friday mosque took place without my presence! Money I gave it, hard cash aplenty, one and six, for the bicycle wouldn’t allow me a reduction of even a halfpenny. Yes, for I said to it, ‘Bicycle, please be lenient’, but it said, ‘Malam, it seems then that you don’t know me. I have vices five: the first is a puncture, when I fire a gun but not with flame And sear the heart and cause the feet to go off in the bush, as if I was not making the journey; Or else, as we go along, I wrench my head away so we fall into the ditch — but I don’t care! My stomach is called a “gear-case” — impertinence to ride something you haven’t bought! My guts are a chain that grabs hold of a gown and we snatch off the rider — I don’t care!. Yet another trouble comes when we reach a plank bridge — a rickety one — and I decide that we won’t go across, But that I’ll get up on the shoulders of my rider and sit there, as if he had never mounted on me.’ Bicycle and Saalè disputed on the bridge and it said, (2) ‘For shame, Saalè! Of course I won’t throw you!’ But as they tipped over, it jerked its head free and — dear me, isn’t that Saalè down in the water there? It followed him, pushing and hitting, saying, ‘Now anyone can come and see whether I haven’t thrown you!’ And it was only when Malam Saalè had managed to strip off his gown that he escaped getting a bellyful of water. He got up and climbed on the bank. The bicycle followed him, for it hadn’t let go of his gown. Then Malam Sanda and the others gathered round the bicycle coaxing it, but it refused to let go, Swearing by Train and Motorcar (3) that it wouldn’t let go unless they used a knife. Then Malam Sanda came to an agreement with the bicycle, professing to like it but apprehensive of its tricks. As it said, ‘Absurd! A leading malam like you? Why, I couldn’t throw an important malam! But if you mount me, you must gather together your gown and trousers and not ride with the voluminous flamboyance of rank!’ So he got on, but still failed to gather in his clothes, and before many minutes had passed it whipped the malam off. Almost immediately threw him down in the middle of his compound in front of his wives, before he could reach the dabee. (4) Says the bicycle, ‘Wait, I’ve made a mistake in throwing you off, malam, since I didn’t take you to the outskirts of the market, For I don’t like to throw off an honest citizen except where people can have a good laugh, And all your bell-ringing and brake-grabbing won’t stop me chucking you off either!’ The other replied, ‘Well, I’m not riding you again, bicycle,’ but the bicycle answered, ‘San fairy ann, what do I care? (5) Whether you ride me or don’t ride me is all one to me — neither will do me any harm that I can see. Hasty riding or wrenching me about won’t take you immediately where you want to be, But if you mount me, first giving me air to drink, there is nowhere where I won’t take you.’ So you see, no one will have a comfortable ride on a bicycle who can’t bring himself to wear his shirt tucked into his trousers.

87b42ef0-d1c6-4361-96ed-1fb4d5e20415,archived,"Read and advise without insults please 🙏 Madam Cynthia, good morning. I need advice from your parliament. The thing is that, two men are asking for my hand in marriage. One is illi/terate, and he is a businessman doing very well . The other one is a graduate, working in a reputable firm. These 2 people are good but the business man shows me so much attention and he is very caring. The graduate is also caring, but I beg for him to give me attention, and I enjoy his attention more than the business person. Like when I wake up in the morning, the business man calls to wake me up, he will check up on me, and he sends me lunch at work sometimes. He is a business person, but he is romantic, and he remembers my birthday more than the other person. The challenge I have now is that, in my entire life, my hopes are to marry a graduate like me. Because of my children, let me raise children with a learned person. I don't know what to do. Like now the business guy, I am the one doing some phone settings for him. He is an introvert fellow. The only thing he knows about the phone is to use and make a call, nothing else. He speaks English very well because he has traveled out and lived almost 7 years abroad and came back. But when I am with the graduate, we flow very well because we discuss work and all. In the last 3 months, I was so ill, the graduate guy, knew before the business guy. I told him on WhatsApp, and he said sorry, I should go get some malaria drugs from the pharmacy. He sent me 10k for it."" The business guys called me that morning, but I didn't tell him, but in the evening, I had to call him and tell him when my body got so hot and i couldn't help myself. He sent his driver to pick me up. He joined us on the way with his own car and took me to his hospital. They ran some tests, and I stayed admitted for 4 days before I got discharged. I told the graduate person but he couldn't visit me at the hospital because he is the branch manager and he couldn't find time to come. But he came the following Sunday and brought me some provisions. Last week Saturday was my birthday and the business guy called me , took me out and told me that he wants to see my people. The graduate guy I had to remind him on Sunday afternoon that yesterday was my birthday. He said he forgot and apologized to me. I am so confused about making a decision. The graduate guy has taken me to see his sister and introduced me as the woman he wants to marry, too. The business guy came from a large family of 10. He is the 8th child of his parents, and he is even marrying late at 39 years. When i asked him why? He said he had a lot of setbacks, and marriage was the last thing on his mind. That his business picked up back again, and he started building on his land at the city.The graduate guy is 33 . I am 29 years old, and I am a pharmacist. Please, I need advice. Hide my id madam Cynthia. Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We are all aware that the recent removal of fuel subsidies at the National level has raised concerns about its impact on ordinary citizens; especially the vulnerable members of the society. While this policy may have its merits, it has also brought about economic challenges, and we cannot afford to overlook the plight of those who are most affected. Allow me to introduce the “Palliative Care” initiative; an all-encompassing initiative that aims to support fellow citizens during these challenging times. Under this program, we will implement the following key measures: 1.

We will also collaborate with local farmers and vendors to ensure food items are affordable through subsidized prices. 3. Skill Development and Job Creation We will create sustainable opportunities for our people by investing in skill development programs and establishment of Small and Medium scale Enterprises (SMEs). We will promote the digital literacy programs and e-commerce platforms to enable small businesses to reach a broader market and adapt to changing economic conductions. 4. Social Support Networks and Targeted Support Program We will strengthen existing SSN such as health care services and education, which will be our priority.In addition, we will engage vulnerable groups such as woman-led households and Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs).

Anuj and Maaya get anxious recalling Maaya kissing Anuj and requesting not to inform Anupama about it as Anupama will misunderstand. Anuj says Maaya doesn’t want him to inform her what happened during picnic. Kavya asks Vanraj if he remembers what he told about his wife to his ex-wife? Vanraj stands with bent head. Kavya says he told he is not happy with Kavya, he hasn’t progressed after marrying her, and he finds peace with Anupama instead. She tells Hasmukh that he spoke a lot more against her. She asks Vanraj how could he speak like that; if he thinks she doesn’t fit in his Hum Saath Saath Hain type family, then she will not put any effort at all; he is so selfish that he wants Anupama back in his life and its good that Anupama gave him a strict warning. Vanraj says she misunderstood. Kavya says her misunderstanding cleared instead, Anupama was right that he can’t be of any one woman... Anuj lies to Anupama that Little Anu ate lots of chocolates and slept without brushing her teeth, he was hiding it from her. Anupama relaxes and says is it. Maaya says she was asking him to hide about it and asks let us go in. Anuj hugs Anupama tightly and feels guilty for lying. Maaya feels jealous seeing that via car mirror. Anuj asks Anupama if she is fine. She says yes and asks what about him. He says hmm and asks about Toshu. She says he is fine and says recalling Vanraj’s words says she wants to tell him something. Maaya purposefully interferes in lieu of getting her bag from car. Anuj holds Anupama’s hand and walks inside home, leaving Maaya more jealous. Kavya warns Vanraj that he destroyed to whatever extent he could and shouldn’t dare try to interfere in her life even by mistake. She seeks Hasmukh’s blessings for her new job and says neither she nor Anirudh are doing anything wrong. She warns Vanraj that he can think whatever he wants to, she will not stop or listen to his nonsense again, enough of respect now... Anupama offers cookies to Little Anu. Little Anu thanks her and says these are her favorite cookies. Anupama says her bebli/Little Anu is her favorite cookie and asks what did she do in picnic. Little Anu says they played games, sang songs, danced, and clicked lots of pictures. Anupama asks Maaya if Little Anu troubled her. Maaya says not at all. Anupama then notices Anuj’s hand injury with Maaya’s sari bandage over it. Anuj says its just a small injury. Maaya says organizers couldn’t arrange a doctor and Anuj was bleeding profusely, so she tied her sari bandage over his wound. Anuj says he is fine. Maaya says he will catch infection and should take tetanus injection. Anupama notices her change in behavior towards Anuj. Anuj goes to change.. Kavya at a cafeteria with Anirudh sips a hot coffee and feels its burn. Anirudh says be it situation or coffee, she should wait till it cools down. He says we cold have met here, then why did she call him to her hose. She says what should she say. He says she wanted show Vanraj. Kavya says more than that, she wanted Vanraj to realize that when he can bring his ex home, even she can. He says basically she just used him. She tries to speak. He says he is joking, he feels good to meet her and knows how a jealous husband feels as even he was a jealous husband once, but to make someone jelouss, they themselves have to burn from within; even she would have felt bad trying make Vanraj jealous. Kavya says he was madly in love with Vanraj.. Anuj walks to his room and recalls the incident again. Maaya thinks Anupama will question Anuj for sure and after learning truth, she will not let Maaya stay for even 15 days; she hopes Anuj doesn’t say anything. Anuj continues to feel guilty. Anupama hugs him from behind. Kavya tells Anirudh says their relationship didn’t work as they both were at mistake, she didn’t want to repeat that mistake with Vanraj and tried her best, but Vanraj has completely changed and is not like before. Anirudh says life before and after marriage won’t be the same, they usually ignore red flags when they are in girlfriend-boyfriend zone and those red flags bother them after marriage, Vanraj’s biggest problem is he is super egoistic. Kavya says even she has defects in her... Anuj tells Anupama that he missed her a lot. Anupama says even she did. He says not more than that as he had left his life at home. Anupama says a lot happens in a day. They both at once say they want to say something. Maaya thinks she doesn’t know what they must be talking, shall she barge into their room. Anirudh suggests Kavya to save her relationship with the best effort she can, but if things get ot of her control and she is not happy in this relationship, she should get out of it and give more preference to herself instead of suffocating in it. Kavya asks if he wants to say something else. Anirudh says she shouldn’t get him wrong, they can start afresh, (truncated)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That day after kissing amanda. I went back home, wallowing in my own Shadow's. I have gotten someone pregnant. I said to my self. You remember all those old nollywood movies, when if you kiss a girl, the next day or something her parents bring the girl to your fathers house that's she pregnant? Men. I wasn't really myself. I couldn't sleep that night. The next day amanda's mom and Amanda came to our house. Immediately I saw her, I was willingly to confess. when they came I brought my mom into her bed room. My father was outside the parlor with the guest so literally I could hear what ever conversation amanda's mom and my dad were having. I opened my mouth to speak out when I heard Amanda mom telling my dad, they were going to need our wheelbarrow for some mini work thats why she came. I got really relieved. Ayochidi talk na. my mom said .. No mommy i wanted to tell you that I want to go and play ball. I told my mom really? my mom asked me. I nodded to yes. My mom felt it strange, because I never tell her when I go to play football. I started avoiding amanda, I wasn't ready to have twins yet. I kept my distance. My mind wasn't still at rest.. 5days later after the kiss.. Amanda's mom rushed to our house.. And told my mom that amanda has been vomiting since yesterday. I saw the world falling down on me... I was mute.. Mommy is true. I did it. I told my mom amanda mom, my mom and my dad was there.. Did what? my mom asked. It was me that made amanda to be pregnant. I said. They were all mute how? my mom asked Promise you won't beat me. I told my mom. I kissed her. I said Ayo, where did you learn that from? my mother asked. Mommy, I'm sorry. I told my mom. The whole place was mute for son seconds. How are you going to take care of the child now? my mother asked me. I don't know. I told my mother. Do you want to drop out of school and be an agbero? she asked. No mommy. I want to be an engineer. I said crying. which house are you going to stay and live with your child? my Mom asked Mommy, I'm sorry. I said they did no Beat me, but everyday for a week, they used to remind me of my fatherly duties. I was devasted. I kept on watching Emmanuel TV. I totally wanted to give my life to Christ. I watched as many church program that I could. Through out that month, I stopped watching Nollywood movies.

People look at me and ask, are you the one fighting, I said yes. As small as I am, I fight people. I get so angry easily. The Spirit of anger takes over me that when people are talking or doing nonsense around me, I don't talk back, I just look for something and stabb the person. I don't have the time exchanging words of abuse with people because in my mind, I reason in a way that if you can not beat me, why are you opening your mouth to talk to me. Anger took over me that if you are talking to me then, I will be quiet because I don't know how to talk back at people, all I want is to do something crazy to the person fighting me, get you off the floor and beat life out of such person and after the fight, people get afraid of me. Perfectedlight. That was the kind of life I use to live before. God has called me into a Spiritual battle but I was ignorant fighting physical battles. I was fighting physical war, fighting and exchanging blows with people.Not just with women, with guys... You don't say because you are a man, you can just talk to me anyhow...I fight you for it. Thank God for my mother, she's a spiritual person God put in my life. She said remember God called you... For some who have seen the story in Youtube.. I received the call of God and also gave my heart to Jesus Christ at the age of 9years old. My mom who has seen the call of God in my life said to me that if I go on like this, I will not get to where God want me to be. She said if I go on with this kind of life of anger, I will not fulfill destiny. My mom then prayed a prayer,I don't know if to call it a prayer or a curse, but my mom made a prayer and said she is going to tell the Lord that anytime I get angry, that the Lord should flog me""Olorun ma nae legba"" translated in Yoruba. She said God will deal with me anytime I get angry.. I actually overlooked it like it was meaningless but guess what? Everytime I get angry , I literarily fall sick. You will think something is wrong with me like i have malaria or something else. I will be shivering. It happened the first time time I thought it was normal until it continued...after sometime, I decided to borrow myself some brain. (I helped my thinking faculty ). That prayer was said so that I don't miss it in life...so that I can fulfill the destiny God had planned for me. So that I will do the things I am doing now. If the Lord didn't helped me I won't be doing what am doing now. If the Lord didn't help me, you will not be blessed by anything am doing now. If the Lord didn't do that Spiritual surgery, that flogging, I will not be here today. I will not be a blessing to thousands. If God has called you Globally, locally and you have the call of God upon your life, a surgery needs to happen in you where you old life dies and you take up the new life of God.

FAITH IS THAT SEEMINGLY INTANGIBLE FORCE TURNING EVERYTHING AROUND FOR GOOD WITHOUT FAITH PERFECT SOUNDNESS OF HEALTH IS IMPOSSIBLE - Bishop David Oyedepo on COME MEET WITH JESUS; THE GREAT PHYSICIAN AND HIS GREAT PRESCRIPTIONS 6 at LFC Canaanland Midweek Communion Service || 30th August 2023 || Part B I have just given you one now. Faith is a non-negotiable requirement for anyone to realize his heritage for healing, health and wholeness. Every other strategy profits little, the one that sets free indeed is your faith in God and His Word. Bodily exercise profits little, it is faith that makes perfectly whole. 1 Timothy 4:8. Acts 3:16. Faith is it. There is so much emphasis on all kinds of things, without faith perfect soundness is impossible. Church Gist. Perfect soundness of a man who has been attacked by stroke is not possible without faith. There can be adjustments and readjustments, but perfection is only possible by faith. That is why you mustn’t toy with your faith. Satan is targeting your faith, if he can get at your faith he has gotten you. Luke 22:31-32. It is faith failure that leads to life failure. COME MEET WITH JESUS, THE GREAT PHYSICIAN AND HIS GREAT PRESCRIPTION, that may look like jokes. Most of the time they don’t appear sensible. They never lack proof. His prescription may not appear sensible but they never lack proof. The triumph of this ministry today by grace is as triggered by faith. That seemingly intangible force turning everything around for good. People can run around the entire world but until you run to Jesus, he is the final bus stop on all health matters. Even doctors will tell you only God can do this. They say ""Be praying, only God can do it."" That God is your father. He paid the price through His son Jesus. You don’t pay for any goods twice. That would be robbery. So show the oppressor your receipt. Jesus was beaten for me, true or false? Here is my receipt. By His stripes, I am healed. You can’t 'unstripe' Him anymore. Church Gist. Here is my receipt. When you go to a shopping mall and you collect your goods and pay the cashier, the security will ask you where is your receipt. Tell every devil standing on the gate of your life, here is my receipt. By His stripes I am healed, here is my receipt. The same day He saved my soul, He paid for my healing. Here is my receipt. Jeremiah 8:19-22. “If I were in Canada, this would not be an issue” Go there, are there not people in Canada that have these issues? They have visited the best hospitals there and it is still on them. If I were in Malaysia by now, they are specialists in these ankle bones. They move God to jealousy because of the people that live in a far country. God can’t do this kind of thing, this kind of thing needs human expertise. What a provocative insult. They don’t know about the balm or the physician in Gilead. Jesus came and said I am that Physician that Jeremiah was talking about. I will have mercy and not sacrifice. He heals on the point of faith, your situations in life notwithstanding. He healed that man and said Go and sin no more lest a worse thing than this comes upon you. Sin brought him into that but he healed him first. Tonight is your night. When it comes to healing, he writes off the case against you to heal you first and tells you “My son, don’t try that again. Is that not good news for you? So you are walking out tonight. Church Gist. We heard the testimony of a prostitute here who was healed of HIV/AIDS. Jesus knew she was a prostitute, she brought herself into that situation but he healed her and she testified. Upon being saved, he writes off your past to restore your health. You are coming out of that situation and it is tonight. You have damaged your lungs through smoking all kinds of nonsense before you met Jesus, He writes it off to heal you and says don’t go back to smoking nonsense again or the attack this time may be deadly. Matthew 9:12-13. What an introduction. When he came he began to manifest that mission as the Great Physician. He was teaching in the synagogues and healing all manner of sickness and diseases. All manners! Matthew 4:23. Church Gist. Virtue came out of Him and healed them all. What a Great Physician, He never referred a case.

ef3d52bd-678f-4e8b-846d-5df7eaed1855,needsReview,"""Lord Jesus Christ Put Your Fingers Into My Ears...!""(Mk. 7:31-37). Twenty-five years ago I attended the TASO-TEACH program in Uganda. (TASO is The AIDS Support Organization. TASO Uganda at that time was considered to be the biggest NGO working on HIV/AIDS in Africa. TEACH is TASO Experiential Attachment to Combat HIV/AIDS). For one month I was with TASO Masaka. My interest in bringing this here concerns one of the challenges that TASO was facing in the Masaka region. HIV/AIDS patients who are placed on antiretroviral treatment are expected to be consistent and regular on taking their drugs. There are some untrained church ministers who think that ""Faith healing"" means healing by prayer alone, without any medication. This according to my TASO mentors was a big challenge. Some patients who had been placed on antirrtroviral therapy were told by some of the faith healers to stop treatment and depend on faith healing alone. Over time the situation of these patients worsened as their CD4 reduced drastically. By the time such patients who were HIV came back to TASO they had developed full blown AIDS. TASO's worry is the same everywhere. There are always those faith healers who deny their sick Christians from taking any kind of treatment; except prayer. The Lord Jesus Christ did not recommend faith healing only; even though he commanded healing. He himself was a medical healer. In the region of Decapolis some people brought to him a deaf and dumb man and begged him to place his hand on the man. Jesus healed the man by first putting his fingers into the man's ears. *""Then he spit and touched the man's tongue.* He looked up to heaven and with a deep sigh said to the man...' In other instances he mixed spittle with mud and asked the patient to go and wash the eyes in a stream. Spittle, mud and water are traditional healing components. It is not a contradiction or lack of faith when churches build hospitals. The medical experts offer treatment but it is God who heals. Pastors are assigned to hospitals as chaplains so that they should be praying for the patients. Not all healing come by prayer or authoritative command in the name of Jesus alone. Curiously, unlike the publicly and widely circulated televised faith healing of some tele-evangelists today, Jesus shunned publicity. When the man's tongue loosened and he started speaking, *'Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone.""* Even though ""the more he did so, the more they kept talking about it,"" *What is good is good and would be talked about, but shouldn't be advertised.* Healing is a tool of evangelism. It is a means to an end. Proclaiming the goodness of the kingdom and calling sinners to repentance is the goal. When in Lystra Paul made a cripple to walk, the people shouted that Paul and Barnabas were gods from Mount Olympus. Paul shouted, *'...We are bringing you good news, telling you to turn from these worthless things to the living God...""*(Acts 14:8-18). The focus was the good news and a call to conversion to the living God through Christ. When king Hezekiah recovered from isickness, he saw his sickness as a means by which God demonstrated his love for him. Among other things he said, *""...You restored me to health and let me live. Surely it was for my benefit that I suffered such anguish. In your love you kept me from the pit of destruction; and you have put all my sins behind your back...""*(Is. 38:9-20). My friend, allegorically, there is a sense in which we are deaf and dumb. We find it difficult to hear God's word and turn to him. We are not able to speak the message of salvation. May the Lord Jesus Christ put his fingers into our ears, may he spit and touch our tongues and may he tell us, ""Be opened!"", so that we can be overwhelmed with amazement because he does everything well. And may we not tire of talking of the marvelous healing that his words brings to our souls. Sunday prayer: Lord Jesus Christ thank you; for by your stripes we are healed. Amen! Have a blessed Sunday! Peace be with you! Rev. Babila Fochang.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But first of all, complete what you are doing, have a sit, , relax, breathe in, borrow a bottle of kadji, take a sip and smile, for it's a long one to read. I got a Facebook message on this faithful Friday ngoilum,from a dp less- profile . It read ""Please I want us to discuss asap"" it's urgent. It ended with the name Habiba. I didn't believe it was Habiba, but thought maybe someone who knew about the story was pulling a fast one on me. My reply to the message was just ok. Two days went by and I didn't hear anything from her. The next day she said this is my Whatsapp number, let's chat on Whatsapp. I took the number reluctantly, but made sure I wasn't the first person to chat her up. Behold she said. I read about our story, and all I can say is that I am deeply sorry. I will explain myself in a subsequent voice message. My heart seemingly stopped beating when I recognized her reassuring voice. My joints went weak, and my mouth filled up with saliva. My intestines moved in a boborythmic tone, and my anal nerves failed before I got into the restroom. It was like the church bell was ringing in my head, and a million voices were arguing at the same time. For a moment I thought I was possessed, or had cerebral malaria. Like a recovering epileptic patient after a seizure, I discovered myself for the first time, lying on the floor.When my senses became right again, I realized, I was excited because Habiba was born again. I didn't know what to tell text her. I was just observing my phone in sheer disbelieve. I was nodding my head like a proud agama lizard after a dangerous fall. I told myself that I was ready for Habiba to come back to me, even if she had 10 children. I started imagining how we will reunite and live happily ever after like in tales. I was even ready to convert into her religion if that will make things work. After entertaining these thoughts I smiled like a dimentia patient after eating a healthy meal. I immediately frowned at myself for entertaining empty thoughts. I made up my mind, wiped my eyes, cleared my throat and sent a voice note. I told Habiba that I forgave her long ago. I equally demanded an explanation to everything. Habiba said after she was bundled to yaounde, she attempted to escape twice, until she received a bitter letter from me telling her that she was very lucky to get married. Because I was in love with another girl in Tatum called Relindis. And I was not planning to marry her. She said even after reading the letter she tried writing a letter to me, too but foolishly sent it through her parents. Her parents naturally killed the letter, the same way they killed our dreams. I cried like a baby after listening to her. I told her, her parents came between us. And made sure nothing worked for us. Habiba thus gave up and concentrated on her marriage after receiving no reply. Her parents paid a typist to type a letter, which they sent to her and made it seem like I was the author. We realized how we were dubbed out of each other's life by her parents. We decided to make a video call, which turned out to be a crying ceremony. Her eyes were red, and swollen. She asked me if I am married or have kids and I said no. She asked me why and I referred her to the words in the poem in the story Habiba. I told her I have tried, but have not been able to love another. Days went by before we communicated again. She asked me how she could help me get over the pain. She even referred me to some of her friends ( including de lavmfu followers) . I told her that i will heal better and faster now, especially after talking with her and knowing the truth. Habiba's marriage turned abusive after she had her 3rd child. She left the marriage and became a single mother. She is a Feminist as we speak. Her name was changed from Habiba to Bishara when she got married. This made it very difficult for me to trace her. Worst of all she was not on social media, in respect of Alahji. But she had better chances of reconnecting with me, than I had. I don't really want to play the blame game here, because it won't unspill the milk. Habiba felt guilty. She wanted amends at all cost. She proposed we meet and discuss . And pave the way forward. But I feel better now after knowing exactly what happened. I am still confused on what to do . Should I really meet Habiba? Can I still win her heart? Will I withstand a 3-0 match? Or should I just try to move on, now that I know the truth? Should I accept her referrals, or search for love myself? I know is that, my heart is ready, but then, what should be my next move? Like a bird I fly, but I can't tell my landing place. #delavmfu",,['malaria'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

be8b48d7-df86-4a2c-86ca-08215e7d77b2,needsReview,"Sah Minister Kosho While working as a director in one of the Prestigious schools in Kribi town I had a case in school . They was this teacher teaching class 5 . I told the proprietress that of all the 23 staff I work with in this school this is the only person who doesn't follow my orders . He goes out of school during break and comes back only when break is over . If I have to complain he doesn't match my height . So one parent brought her daughter to school in September for registration she was to go to class 5. A girl of around 12 years and she already developed features of a girl at puberty. Her father was an Italian even though she was pure black ( adopted ) . I tried to talk with the pupil and understanding that she was a slow learner that one my parents will term a Yikinoran . I proposed she should go back to class 4 but the parent said we could get a private teacher as well to handle the child so as to boost up her level . The same teacher teaching her in school was proposed with a pay package of 50k and to teach her at home 4 times per week . Her class teacher was also doing repetition with other kids in school on Monday Wednesday and Friday 5k each and 40 children out of around 60 children in his class . One day the class 2 madam rushed with the girl into my office and told me she was menstruating . I sat her down and tried reaching her Dad . He could not pick my call . She was bleeding and we just removed her pullover and tied around her stained waist . I brought her close to me and said ; "" My daughter, in primary school class 5 you are already transforming into a grown up woman . You have to be very careful . If anyman touches you from your breast to other private parts, you will get pregnant . Remember that white man just adopted you . If you dare share your body with a man at your age you will get pregnant and no one will bring you to Italy for any reason"". She was quiet and I then ask if someone has ever touched her? she said No she was in tact and doing well . Her Daddy finally arrived in the afternoon I was mad at the man . I asked him if I have ever called him and beg for money or food he was calm . How can I call you the whole day and you are coming at this hour ? Okay that is your daughter bleeding there take her home clean her up and try talking sex education with her to add to what I already told her . The man said he was sorry and they left . After around 2 months a group of police men from the special semil stormed the school and asked to see the Head teacher . They were ushered into my office and I asked them what was happening . They said they wanted to see a teacher by name Mr.... I called the class 5 teacher to come and they said this guy has been r@ping this little girl in the school toilets since she arrived this school . It was discovered because the little girl is sick and doctors confirmed she is very sick due to forcing the way into the small shijajah . I could not even believ the guys so I turned to the teacher and asked if he could do something like this . To my greatest shock this guy said yes HM I have been doing it . The girl's mother was unconsolable inside her car . From that year at the beginning of covid till today the guy is in prison . When I called the owner of the institution to explain the situation in her own shock she remembered I already told her that this teacher was the most difficult staff in my cabinet . That is the same day I was told that every break he goes out to smoke weed . The mother of the little girl said Doctors are confirming that she might never have a child in her lifetime . Moral lesson: For a 12 years old girl to hide such a fresh evil act from me after the holy spirit advised me to talk to her and save the situation means that girl also had some reasoning disabilities . #delavmfu",,['covid-19'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

THERE IS A GULLIBLE GENERATION THAT THINKS THAT GRAMMAR IS UNCTION WHEN REVIVAL HAPPENS, SPIRITUAL CLIMATES ARE SANITIZED. WHAT IS REVIVAL"" || International Ministers' Flaming Fire Conference 2023 DAY 1 EVENING SESSION || Glory Dome, Abuja || 22nd August 2023 || Part C I think I have told you everything about number 3. We saw how Elijah humiliated the prophets of Baal. Church Gist. He said, ""Catch them, let none run"". That is what to do with the devil and his agents in the season of revival. 4. The Liberation and restoration of a people to health, wholeness and liberty. Acts 8:7. During a revival there is an unction in the air to restore people to health, there is an unction in the air to check out devils. That was what Oral Roberts said concerning the healing revival, he said healing was very easy because it looked like healing was literally in the air. It was as if it was in the atmosphere. We are about to see those days again, in fact, we are seeing those days again when the climate is so thick. People step into church and they step out of wheelchairs. We saw three people rise from wheelchairs this morning. Not a minor issue of he was weak so he sat down, spinal tuberculosis. Tuberculosis of the Spine paralyzed and crippled him. Lumbar spondylosis crippled and paralyzed the second one, I don’t know what was the case of the third one. He had a hip situation like arthritis of the hip or something. Church Gist. All of them jerked up from the wheelchair. One person removed his neck collar and was healed. Another person who had cervical spondylosis was seeing that happening, he ran out and began to move his neck. In other words, what am I carrying when this man is healed? Nobody called him, nobody mentioned it. He ran out with fire, with violence and with aggression. I announce to you before you pray for the next person who is sick, every affliction is flushed out of your own body in the name of Jesus. For somebody, I am anointed to announce to you that this is the convention of your liberty. Whatever is wrong with you biologically, physiologically, or anatomically, I declare today that they are cleared out. It is the restoration of a people. That was what happened to the Israelites. Church Gist. God said I have seen the afflictions of my people and I have come to deliver them. That was revival. 5. The sanitization of spiritual climates and territories. When revival happens, spiritual climates are sanitized. Spiritual climates over territories are sanitized, they are purified. When God said I am going to clear out the air over Egypt, it means I am going to clear out the gods over Egypt. Exodus 12:12. When Elijah said “Hold the prophets of Baal, let none of them escape '' and he slew 400 prophets of Baal and 450 prophets of Asherah and threw down their altar. Church Gist. That was a sanitization of the climate in that territory. When Philip finished with Samaria, if Philip had left and left Simon in Samaria, the work was not finished. That is plus one minus one. For as long as Simon was still there somebody will still be sick, somebody will still be lame, somebody will still be crippled, somebody will still be deceived. Many of you have Simons around you. Some of you have Simons that are your friends but you didn’t know them. You have Simons you listen to but you don’t know them. Acts 8:9. His source is sorcery, his source is witchcraft. He advertised himself not as a sorcerer, not as a wizard but as a great one who carried the power of God. Acts 8:10. Everybody listened to him. He is on social media, he has great followership. There are many sorcerers carrying the microphone. Many whose source is witchcraft. They have confused the lives of people, confused the mind of the Church and believers. There are people you go to their office and you see the picture of an authentic servant of God, the second picture is that of a sorcerer. You see a sticker of an authentic oil, you see another sticker of a sorcerer. Many of them we know each other. I have asked many people to ask some people ‘what is your root?’ ‘This authority you are in, which authority are you under?’ ‘Who born you?’ How do you want to give birth without being born? Who is your father? You have references of several people, which one is your father? This is what is about to happen and I speak this with passion.

She kept bugging me to think deeper if I knew any of my family members who knew so much about the internet. After so much thoughts, I realised that my brother whom my husband killed was the only computer brain in our family. But he was dead so there was no way. For days we both sat in the house doing nothing. We only where hoping the d.p.o got no lead to how my maid husband and gate man was killed. One morning while I was in the parlour watching tv. I overheard my friend who was bathing calling out to me. ""Jessica I don see am come!"" She repeatedly said. I rushed up and found her in the secret room tying only wrapper . ""Watin happen watin you see ?"" I asked anxiously. 01 RETPAHC ""I was taking my bath when I saw a shadow pass. Then I took a peep. I couldn't see the person clearly because he swiftly ran into this room. Before I could tie my towel and followed, he was no where to be found."" ""So, your saying all these while we have been staying with a stranger or somebody in this house?"" ""Definitely. Wait I think he is the one who killed the house help, if you remember exactly how he was shot"" she replied thoughtfully. We were still discussing when I felt something in my Tommy and ran to the bathroom and throw up. My friend was amused because I never had any symptoms of malaria. We both argued on the theory that I wasn't pregnant. After so much argument we finalised on letting the doctor have the final say. We went to the hospital and ran a test. We waited for a day before the results came out and it proved that I was pregnant. As of this point I was confused if it was for my husband or the maid. One day I was sitting in my room eating some apple's when my friend screamed from upstairs where she was sleeping. ""Jess help me!. They'll kill me!"" I quickly rushed to her aid but as I opened the door she was alone, there was no sign of anybody but she was coughing and holding her neck like some one who was strangled. ""Babe watin happen , who want kill you?"" I asked kneeling and holding her shoulders. ""He was straggling me I think he wants to kill me. Jess( short form of Jessica) what do we do?. I don't want to die. Jess if I die who would care for my children?"" She replied amidst tears. ""God forbid! You will need die!"" I assured her. At this point my heart was heavy because I dragged her into all of this. I wish I never knew her or I never was her friend. I hated myself but at the same time if not for her I couldn't have gotten this far. I didn't say any words out loud to her .

Sakiru Olanrewaju Ambali, 45, was arrested in February 2023, in Frankfurt, Germany, as he traveled back to Canada from Nigeria. Ambali had been detained in Germany pending extradition. He arrived in the Western District of Washington on Friday afternoon. Ambali and codefendant Fatiu Ismaila Lawal, 45, are accused of using the stôlen identities of thousands of Americans to submit over 1,700 claims for pandemic unemployment benefits to over 25 different states, including Washington State. According to the indictment, Lawal and Ambali used the stôlen personal information of thousands of U.S. taxpayers and residents to file fraudulent claims for COVID-19 pandemic assistance and false tax returns seeking refunds. In total, the claims sought approximately $25 million, but the conspirators obtained approximately $2.4 million, primarily from pandemic unemployment benefits. The co-conspirators allegedly submitted claims for pandemic unemployment benefits to more than 25 states including New York, Maryland, Michigan, Nevada, California, and Washington. Using 13 Google accounts they filed some 900 claims. The co-conspirators also allegedly established four internet domain names that they then used for fra¥d – creating some 800 different email addresses that were used for fra¥d.

Africans should not denounce herbalism because of Islam or Christianity. There is hardly any disease that herbs cannot cure. Read Genesis 1:29. God created man to eat herbs. Most sickness on Earth occurs because we have shifted from this divine diet, to eat all kinds of food that put pressure on our bodies. Herbalism restores the divine balance in your body by resetting you to your factory setting. Prophets in Scripture regular practiced herbalism 2 Kings 4:39. African herbalism is not evil. Embrace it. If you have ever had malaria and took agbo as a remedy, or had psoriasis, eczema, or other skin problems and used ose dudu (AKA dudu osun), you would never call herbalism evil. African herbs are potent. And we should not allow Christianity or Islam to scare us away from our heritage. Our universities should be offering degree courses on traditional African herbalism. There is a reason why our ancestors lived longer and stronger lives than we do. It is because they never ingested chemical pharmacopoeia. They had chewing stick for their oral health and used eti-erin (aloe vera) as an antibacterial while using kaolin for their digestive health. They equally used ewe asunwon (cassia alata, or senna alata) as an antiviral medication. They cured impotence with the dregs of palm oil and by consuming unripe plantains, amongst other things. We should not let these ancient wisdoms die out. Neither should we be ashamed of them. These are African botanicals, and we should be proud of them. I am a follower of Yeshua, and I believe in African herbalism.

b20ebe9b-643f-4e16-a9b8-39d4f6477990,needsReview,"It is imperative for us to exercise caution and discernment when it comes to certain churches that are being established within our communities. While there is a freedom of religion and association, we must be mindful of the motives behind the establishment of these churches. Recent instances, such as the Church of Ogbanje in Nnewi North and similar establishments, emphasize the need for vigilance. A notable example is the Church of Satan in Ohafia, Abia State, which was demolished in 2020 and its founder, Ifekwe Udo, was arrested by the State police command. This occurrence highlights the negative influence that such churches can have on the Igbo community. Ifekwe Udo, also known as Lucifer or Fada-Fada, was apprehended for violating COVID-19 lockdown rules back in 2020. Additionally, he was accused of causing disturbances within the community, which eventually led to local youth destroying the satanic imagery present outside his church. It is worth mentioning that Udo initially established his church under a different name, aligning it with our Igbo culture, before diverting to the Church of Satan. This serves as a reminder of the importance of caution when considering involvement with similar churches that claim to promote Igbo culture, yet fail to do so authentically. Therefore, it is crucial for us to thoroughly evaluate the motives and actions of churches before becoming involved. By doing so, we safeguard our traditions and ensure that genuine cultural values are upheld within our communities.",['religious-practices'],['covid-19'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Virus-tracking researchers detected the Omicron spin-off – nicknamed Pirola but also known scientifically as BA.X/BA:=:http://BA.X/BA.2.86 – in a patient hospitalised in London. The unidentified patient is thought to have caught the strain within the UK. UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) bosses did not reveal exactly how many cases have been spotted so far. But top scientists claim the discovery means 'we can be pretty sure it's circulating more widely'. Only six cases of the strain first spotted last month have been detected so far worldwide, in the US, Denmark, and Israel. The three Danish cases 'are from different parts of the country, and do not appear to have had contact with each other', it said, indicating community transmission. Dr Meera Chand, deputy director of the UKHSA told MailOnline: 'We are aware that BA.2.86 has been detected in the UK. 'UKHSA is assessing the situation and will provide further information in due course.' Dr. Luke Blagdon Snell, a physician specialising in infectious diseases and microbiology, claimed a patient at Guys and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust in London had the strain. The infection had been acquired 'locally', he said.   Dr Blagdon Snell later added there was no 'immediately obvious' connection between the UK case and others seen across the world. | 'Real deal' Covid variant is now in Britain as Patient is hospitalised in London COVID HOSPITALISATIONS SINCE JUNE 7-day-rolling average PIROLA BA.X Ba.2.86 200 150 100 09 Jun 16 Jun 23 Jun 30 un 14 07 Jul 21 Jul 28 Jul 04 Aug 11 Aug","['variants', 'case-reporting', 'rfi', 'prevention-collective', 'alternative-cures', 'symptoms-severity', 'medical-exploitation', 'capacity', 'bioweapon', 'prevention-individual', 'stigmatization', 'conspiracy', 'religious-practices', 'corruption', 'treatment']",['covid-19'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Africans should not denounce herbalism because of Islam or Christianity. There is hardly any disease that herbs cannot cure. Read Genesis 1:29. God created man to eat herbs. Most sickness on Earth occurs because we have shifted from this divine diet, to eat all kinds of food that put pressure on our bodies. Herbalism restores the divine balance in your body by resetting you to your factory setting. Prophets in Scripture regular practiced herbalism 2 Kings 4:39. African herbalism is not evil. Embrace it. If you have ever had malaria and took agbo as a remedy, or had psoriasis, eczema, or other skin problems and used ose dudu (AKA dudu osun), you would never call herbalism evil. African herbs are potent. And we should not allow Christianity or Islam to scare us away from our heritage. Our universities should be offering degree courses on traditional African herbalism. There is a reason why our ancestors lived longer and stronger lives than we do. It is because they never ingested chemical pharmacopoeia. They had chewing stick for their oral health and used eti-erin (aloe vera) as an antibacterial while using kaolin for their digestive health. They equally used ewe asunwon (cassia alata, or senna alata) as an antiviral medication. They cured impotence with the dregs of palm oil and by consuming unripe plantains, amongst other things. We should not let these ancient wisdoms die out. Neither should we be ashamed of them. These are African botanicals, and we should be proud of them.

c346bc4d-cdc9-4957-9d35-c4fd3474644a,reviewed,"Read and advise without insults, please 🙏 Good morning, Madam Cynthia. Please, I need help with advice and everything. My husband passed on when my our only son finished primary school. He was 11 years then. I could barely feed myself then. My sister inlaw came and took my son to the north to live with them. She promised me that she would help train him but she didn't send my son to school for 5 years he lived with them. After 4 years, I found out and asked her to bring him back for me. She dragged her feet for a year more before bringing him back. He came back to a different human being. He became so quiet and hardly spoke his mind. This was a boy who was very outspoken and always 1st in class before my husband died. At first, he didn't want to tell me anything. But the only thing he told me was that he can't continue schooling, that he will look for apprentice work to help me train his siblings. I have 3 children. He later found somewhere a bit far from home, but the person asked him to come and live with him. He refused to live with anybody because of the experience he had living with my sister inlaw. It was in the process of all these that he opened up to me what he went through. He was mol_ested many times by my sister inlaw's husband, who passed on last year. People should not blame me here. We couldn't speak out because we don't have anybody to fight for us. The day I couldn't help it, and I told my mother inlaw, she said it's not possible, that can my son defend the allegations if taken to the shrine? They are too fetish, I had to cry inside with my child because nobody would believe him when he talked. We treated a lot of infection when he came back, and he really went through pains until the last hospital we went to. After running plenty of test, they told us he has hepatitis B. I have spent a lot on medication and hospital admission on his head, and I am tired of spending on him, i dont have any savings any longer. My little provision shop is almost empty because of drugs, series of tests, and medications i buy for him. He is always sickly, and he always loses appetite. Madam Cynthia, please let the doctors in your forum tell me what to do because he is my only son. Because of this his experience, I don't want my 2 daughters to visit anybody without me going with them. What can I do to help him because watching him every day struggle with his life is the worst experience of my life. Even a woman I trusted so much to tell my predicament is telling people that my son looks like he has HIV. She stopped her children from coming to see my children. Hide my id . I need the doctors who are very experienced to give me advice please. Thank you for reading.","['rfi', 'treatment']","['hiv', 'hepatitis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1704a987-8e65-42fd-8960-152c8b2bb247,reviewed,"Air pollution is worse than HIV and malaria: Research Africa and Asia are the continents with the most air pollution in the world, and they receive the least financial support to curb the problem. The most polluted air is found in Africa and Asia. / Photo: Reuters Air pollution is more harmful to people's health than smoking or alcohol, where this threat is increasing in the places where the most polluted air is found - that is South Asia and China, as research has confirmed. Yet funding allocated to address the challenge is a fraction of the amount allocated to combat disease, said a study from the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC). The institute's annual report on air quality shows that polluted air from automobiles and factories, forest fires and the like - is the ""greatest threat to public health."" If the world would try to reduce these things that cause air pollution to achieve balance, as the World Health Organization said, people would add 2.3 years to their life expectancy as some data from 2021 show. Small particles that pollute the air are linked to lung and heart disease, stroke and diabetes. Africa and Asia are the most affected. The use of tobacco in cigarettes reduces life expectancy by 2.2 years, while the lack of proper nutrition for children is responsible for reducing life expectancy by 1.6 years. Three-fourths of the effects of air pollution are in three countries - Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, China, Nigeria and Indonesia, according to a report. Asia and Africa are the most affected by the situation and they do not have good infrastructure to help the people. They are also the least supported in the world. For example, the entire continent of Africa is receiving funding of less than 300,000 dollars to fight air pollution. ""There is a huge disparity between the place where air pollution is the worst and the place where a lot of money is being sent to solve the problem,"" Christa Hasenkopf, director of air quality at EPIC, told AFP. Life expectancy Although there is an international financial cooperation called the 'Global Fund' which allocates four billion dollars to HIV/AIDS, Malaria, Tuberculosis and other life-threatening diseases every year, there is no such thing. the cost of air pollution. ""However, air pollution shortens the life expectancy of the average person in the DRC (Democratic Republic of the Congo) and Cameroon more than HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other health-threatening diseases,"" the report said. Across the world, South Asia is the most affected by this pollution. Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan are the most polluted countries every year in terms of particles that follow the air from smoke, which satellites can see particles with a length of 2.5 microns or less. From there, the polluted air is added to the air quality meter to measure the effect of the air on life expectancy. Residents of Bangladesh where the average level of PM2.5 air quality is 74 micrograms, will gain 6.8 more years of life if this is brought to the WHO standard of 5 micrograms per cubic meter. Continued efforts China, on the other hand, ""has made great progress in the fight against pollution"" which began in 2014, Hasenkopf said. The country's air pollution has decreased by 42.3 percent from 2013 to 2021. If this progress continues, the average Chinese resident will have an extra 2.2 years of life. In the United States, legislation such as the Clean Air Act has helped reduce air pollution by 64.9 percent since 1970, adding 1.4 years to Americans' lives. However, the increase in wildfires - which is related to hotter and drier areas due to climate change - is causing more air pollution in the western United States, Latin America and Southeast Asia. For example, the forest fires in California in 2021 resulted in the presence of airborne pollutants in the Plumas region more than five times higher than WHO limits. The story of North America's progress in reducing air pollution in recent years is similar to that of Europe, but there are still differences between Western and Eastern European countries, with Bosnia being the most polluted country on the continent.","['symptoms-severity', 'capacity']","['hiv', 'malaria']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The order was given by the Maryland court judge to arrest him. Indeed according to our sources, in 2020, during the period of the COVID-19 pandemic, the American government under Donald Trump set up a Covid fund entitled Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) Loan, in the form of a loan to help to Businessmen and others to prevent the American economy from going bankrupt. The said fund was non-repayable if the debtors could prove that they did exactly what they borrowed the money for. To benefit from it, you had to present guarantees. This is how Eric Tataw sets up a fake business, giving the impression that he is a businessman when it was to abuse the American state and enrich himself. After having benefited, he began to lead a bourgeois lifestyle, buying luxury cars, big houses, leading the life of a jet-setter in the United States. This attracted the attention of American authorities who began investigating him and finding that he is a fraudster who has no real business. The Maryland court judge therefore issued a warrant for his arrest and he was arrested last Thursday. He is currently in police custody and has submitted a request for release on bail which will be processed next Friday September 8, 2023. Some complaints may still be added to this accusation brought against him. Knowing that he is now in trouble, Eric Tataw wanted to intimidate and corrupt the witnesses called by federal justice. For information, the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) is a $953 billion business loan program established by the United States federal government under the Trump administration in 2020 through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief (CARES) Act. , and Economic Security Act) to help certain businesses, salaried workers, individual entrepreneurs and certain non-profit organizations.

Hadizat Abubakar, sent by Abuja, National Headquarters of INEC, confirmed on oath that, Abia State Labour Party did not submit its party membership register to INEC, 30 days before the purported gubernatorial primary election. *The Witness who presented evidence on behalf of the Abuja, National Headquarters of INEC, said she works in the Election Party and Monitoring Department of INEC, Abuja. She relied on her written deposition and adopted same as her evidence before the Tribunal. *During her oral evidence, she tendered the six (6) documents, mentioned in paragraph (4A-F) as listed in her written deposition and a, 7th document, which is the authority letter issued to her by INEC, National Headquarters, Abuja, authorising her to testify on its behalf. *Upon cross examination by lawyers to the Respondents, Barr. Hadizat maintained that documents must be authenticated from their records before National Headquarters will certify them. She insisted that she was at the Tribunal on official capacity because of the subpoena and has no personal opinion on the matter. The Subpoenaed witness also agreed that INEC has State offices but that the Abuja, National Office controls all other INEC State Offices and Formations. * Another Petitioner's Witness, (PW16), also a Subpoena Witness adopted her written deposition affirming that Abia State Labour Party did not conduct any gubernatorial primary election. She tendered her ID card and letter of authority from INEC and relied on same as her evidence before the Court. She confirmed working in the Legal Drafting and Clearance Department of INEC. *Upon cross examination, she was confronted by Otti's lawyer with a letter and payment receipt which she also confirmed signing as INEC's report, confirming it monitored Labour party gubernatorial primary election. Meanwhile, the said document has no name, undated and unsigned. *The Witness, PW16, contradicted herself as she has already tendered in evidence and adopted same on oath, a report certified by INEC National Headquarters, Abuja confirming it didn't monitor any congress, convention or primary election of Abia Labour Party. The INEC, Abuja authenticated letter has a reference number, name and date. *Upon close perusal of the documents which Otti's lawyer confronted the witness with, it was discovered that the controversial report claiming to confirm a purported Abia Labour Party gubernatorial primary election has neither an official reference number, name, date, nor signature and it emanated from INEC office in Abia State instead of the Abuja, National Headquarters that deals directly with political parties, thereby, rendering it a nullity. *However, the said documents were tendered as exhibit, while the Petitioner's lead counsel Prof. Paul Ananaba SAN, who led other Senior Advocates like, Elder Chibuike Nwokeukwu, Emeka Okpoko, Chief Henry Akunebu, Sir, Chief Uche Ihediwa and others, objected most vehemently to admitting the said documents and to give reasons for their objection during written address. *On the sideline after the court proceedings, Barr. E. Ekeh, who has been following the matter was of the opinion that Labour Party and Alex Otti are curiously seeking to override the authority of the National Headquarters of INEC by conjuring unsigned and undated documents from Abia State INEC office to counter the superiority of certified true copies from INEC's Headquarters in Abuja. He called the controversial document an after-thought from the Respondents which the smuggled in, even as they didn't plead it in their reply to the Petitioners petition. *He also said that his sources told him,(subject to confirmation), that Labour Party is in a desperate move to hurriedly manufacture an emergency, fake Party Register endorsed by a compromised Abia State INEC office into the matter as their defence. *Barr. Ekeh insisted that the information about the fake party membership register should be quickly investigated and exposed urging the Petitioners to be vigilant as Equity aids the vigilant not the indolent, ""Vigilantibus non Dormientibus Aequitas Subvenit."" *He concluded by saying ""with what happened today, it is now obvious that Alex Otti and Abia Labour Party is in a Cul De Sac as all their attempts to manufacture an emergency Party Membership Register to subvert the cause of justice have hit a brickwall"". *Matter was adjourned to tomorrow, 11th, August, 2023. @ORACLE. | Photos from Ndi Abia's post",,"['measles', 'smallpox', 'anthrax', 'chlamydia', 'dengue', 'filariasis', 'marburg', 'mpox', 'polio', 'syphilis', 'tetanus', 'cholera', 'gonorrhea', 'herpes', 'tuberculosis', 'rotavirus', 'lassa', 'meningitis', 'onchocerciasis', 'chickenpox', 'hantavirus', 'hiv', 'influenza', 'rabies', 'rsv', 'trichomoniasis', 'trypanosomiasis', 'zika', 'hpv', 'covid-19', 'ebola', 'leishmaniasis', 'malaria', 'schistosomiasis', 'typhoid', 'hepatitis', 'diphtheria']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Amba asks Satya to forget whatever happened in the past and start his life afresh. Satya rides his bike recalling the moments spent with his girlfriend who asks if he will get serious when she leaves his wife. Amba stops Sai and asks her to suggest Satya to marry and describes the importance of marriage. Virat notices Sai’s sari getting trapped in a cycle wheel and pulls her duppata away on time. Amba misunderstands him as a roadside goon and tongue lashes him for pulling an unknown girl’s dupatta. Virat tries to speak, but Amba continues to scold him. Virat says he knows Sai well and her dupatta was getting trapped in a wheel, so he had to pull it out. Amba continues. Sai stops he and says she knows Virat well and asks her to continue her shopping. Amba leaves. Virat asks who was that woman. Sai says Satya’s mother and asks why did he come there. He returns her mobile she left in his car and warns her to stay away from Satya and his mother. Pakhi meets an advocate and asks if he fights civil or criminal cases. Advocate says both and asks what is her problem. She says both. Sai reaches hospital where senior doctor Survase informs that medical council members would be coming any time, but Satya hasn’t come yet. Sai says Satya left long ago.

Sheetal reveals that she is a single mother as her husband died 2 years ago due to COVID, her son suffered a head injury and when she informed Satya, he rushed with her to treat her son; a goon troubles her in her area, so Satya drops her home and made sure that good is arrested.

The fever left her and she got up and began to serve Jesus. In the evening many who were demon-possessed were brought to him and he drove out the demons with a word and healed all the sick. As part of the fulfilment prophecies, Matthew says, *""This was to fulfil what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah, 'He took our infirmities and carried our diseases.'""* Some years back when the AIDS pandemic was very scary, some African theologians used the strong metaphor that *""the body of Christ has AIDS.""* This is not in the sense that Christ himself is physically sick, but that within the Church, which is the body of Christ, some members have AIDS. The metaphor was a call for concern, a need for solidarity with the sick in the face of stigmatization. In stating that Christ took up our infirmities and carried our diseases, Isaiah was rehashing the image of the scapegoat. On the day of atonement Aaron was to cast lots for two goats. ""...one for the LORD and the other for the scapegoat...*the goat chosen by lot as the scapegoat shall be presented alive before the LORD to be used for making atonement by sending it into the desert as a scapegoat...""* Aaron had to lay his both hands on the head of the scapegoat and confess over it all the wickedness and rebellion of the Israelites - all their sins - and put them on the goat's head..."" He was then to send the goat away into the desert in the care of someone appointed for the task. *""The goat will carry on itself all their sins to a solitary place; and the man shall release it in the desert""*(Lev.16:8ff). The scapegoat was released in the desert where it will wander and starve to death or be devoured by wild beasts. 👆🏽This is the sense in which Christ took up our infirmities and carried our diseases. And this is the sense in which any person who is framed up and punished innocently is a scapegoat. Christ became the replacement for the scapegoat of Levicticus. Unlike the Levitical annual scapegoats, Christ became the scapegoat once and for all. On the sideline of this story, Peter's mother-in-law sets a good example for our time. *When Jesus touched her hand and the fever left her, she got up and began to attend to Jesus.* I suppose you now know what to do when the Lord Jesus Christ touches you! Prayer: Holy Spirit help me for a prompt and positive response to my Lord's touch. Amen! Have a blessed day! Peace be with you! Prayer point: Pray for spiritual healing in the body of Christ.

A month later I began developing some funny symptoms of malaria and little boils on me. It kept on for a week, before my boss requested I go take a test. I took the test and the results showed I was HIV positive. Tears didn't stop flowing down my cheeks as I knew my world has ended. I began thinking of how to get back at my brother, because I felt he was the cause of my down fall. My boss sacked me and sent me packing back to my father's house....by now my brother was done with higher institutions and gotten a well paid job. I month after I went back to my father's house my brother got married to his girlfriend. I warned her of my brother before the marriage but she saw me as a stumbling block . A week after their honeymoon, I and my brother was left alone in the house, he was in the living room while I was in the kitchen. I was washing the dishes when my brother came behind and spanked my ass, with no thought, I bit my cheeks and kissed him as the blood flowed. He was a bit shocked and wanted more but I stopped him. That evening when his wife came back, I warned her of not sleeping with her husband, but she reported me to my dad and I was chased out of the house. 4months later my dad called me back for a meeting with the whole family. After a prayer he began confessing; "" Your Mom cheated on me 2years after our marriage and I forgave her after she pleaded. Two months later she began developing some symptoms of malaria and I charged her to the hospital, were she was confirmed HIV positive alongside with me. This got me angry to the extent, when you both were born i transferred my hatred on your sister as replacement for your mom. I slept with her not because I wanted to but because I wanted her to have the disease and feel the pain for your mom, please forgive me."" He stood up and begged. Tears filled the whole room, as my brother was frustrated because he was now infected alongside his wife. My brother couldn't hold himself as he strangled my father to death......I silently smiled and walked out of the room . Two days later my brother was arrested and charged to the court by me, he stood no chances of winning. The judge sentenced him to death by hanging. I was left with my family's wealth. My brother's wife who was pregnant for my brother begged to stay with me. I accepted but a week later I poisoned her food and she lost the baby. Now everything is mine.

By McLawre... | Importance of tracking cases of TB
 
By McLawrencePhiri

Tuberculosis (TB) is an airborne infectious disease that mostly affects the lungs and is caused by a bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mtb. It presents with the following signs and symptoms; a cough that lasts more than three weeks, chest pain, coughing up blood, feeling tired all the time, night sweats, chills, fever, loss of appetite and weight loss. 
TB spreads through the air when infected people cough, sneeze or spit. The common risk factors for developing TB include: poor nutrition that can be due to poverty, HIV infection, homelessness or crowding in a place or room with no proper ventilation e.g. in jail or prison (where close contact can spread infection), substance abuse, taking medication that weakens the immune system, kidney disease and diabetes, organ transplants.
In the 20th century, TB was a leading cause of death in the United States of America and parts of sub-Sahara Africa. TB is managed using a combination of antimicrobial drugs with high cure rates coupled with good adherence for durations of six to 24 months.
Early case detection and treatment is key to stop the chain of transmission of tuberculosis. Of late there has been an increase of drug resistant TB which requires a combination of different anti-TB drugs. These cases of drug resistant TB are a result of suboptimal treatment, treatment disruptions and discontinuation of therapy due to loss of contact with patients. This creates a public health challenge as such cases may be a source of spreading drug resistant organisms in the households and the community at large.
Disease progression and poor treatment outcomes should be prevented through knowledge of the cascade of TB care. Patients who present with symptoms suggestive of TB should be screened through active case finding and once an infection is found it is termed as an active case and should be managed by the designated site within the healthcare facility.
Active case finding, allows for many undetected cases to be identified which may have been missed, both in the community and at the healthcare facility.
There are two main effective ways of active case finding: the door-to-door index tracing screening all the contacts to the active case and the community approach of targeting the risk populations and hot spots. In both methods contacts must be referred and encouraged to visit the healthcare facility for full screening which is done by the lab.
On the other hand, TB case finding can also be done within the health facility at all entry points such as Out‐Patient Department (OPD), during Antenatal, under five clinic and labour/ maternity to all those with suggestive TB symptoms.
Health personnel in facilities are very key in coming up with mappings for hot spots and groups at-risk as this is what may also determine on strategy for surveillance, epidemiology, resources and health system for mitigating such challenges. Of worth noting also is that there are different active case finding activities that may be required in hard-to-reach areas and TB hot spots with low access to health facilities
There is need for intensive awareness raising and sensitisation, screening of communities particularly at-risk and populations or those with limited access to healthcare in hot spots. At household contact tracing is the most effective way that intensifies case finding. All patients suspected to be infected or exposed to TB infection should be traced and actively tracked in the community and TB treatment and prevention therapy provided to stop TB.

My body is feeling somehow since we returned from Dubai.” Chidiogo said to Chike that Friday morning when both of them were preparing to go out. They had slept together the night before. Chike was preparing to go to Authority Bank where the board of directors is waiting for him to present the result of his investigation into the N3 billion fraud. “What exactly is happening to you? I notice you sleep a lot lately and you appear to be weak. Are you sure you don’t have malaria? Anyway, it is good that you are going to run some tests, so we will know what it is.” Chike responded. They both kissed and departed the house. Deep down her heart, Chidiogo was very scared about going to the hospital and she knew it might not be malaria. Besides, her period has been delayed by four days now, so she wasn’t sure what was happening to her body, but the tests will confirm. Meanwhile, Chike arrived at Authority Bank and he was ushered into the conference hall and led to the podium so he could address the board. The hall was packed full with everyone that matters at the Authority Bank. Stern-looking policemen and security lurked around the vicinity as if on a special mission. Mr Achibong was present and he was seated at the front row. Chike lifted his head from the podium to start speaking and his eyes ‘jammed’ with those of Mr Achibong, but he ignored him and went ahead with his presentation. “Good morning everyone. I would like to go straight to the report without wasting our time. I will also present just the summary of the report and then make copies available for those who wish to read further.” Chike started. His voice sounded very confident. “The investigation I carried out almost took my life, but God intervened.” He said. Everyone in the hall muttered some sounds as if in confirmation of what he just said. Mr Achibong had his left hand wedging his chin as he listened with rapt attention like a student. “My investigation revealed that the CEO of Authority Bank by the name, Mr Achibong runs an international drug business and he also controls a cartel of internet fraudsters. The N3 billion fraud which was averted by me at the Authority Bank did not just happen. Mr Achibong gave out the banking details of high-profiled customers to his cartel of hackers and they successfully moved the funds to an account he created. Thankfully, the account has been frozen.” Chike said. The hall by then went dead with silence. Everyone looked in the direction where Mr Achibong was seated. “That is pretty much the report. The only thing I have to add is that Mr Achibong transferred me to Dubai and ordered his boys to eliminate me because of the content of this report. But here we are today. I will spare you the complicated details of the investigation and just hand that over to the police to aid their prosecution of the suspects. Thank you for the trust invested in me.” Chike said. As soon as he was done, security men stormed the hall and arrested Mr Achibong and whisked him away. Chike was very tired when he returned from the Authority bank to meet Chidiogo who was already back from the hospital. He took two hours to sleep and rest his head. And then he came down to eat lunch prepared by Chidiogo. “I have a confession to make. And please, don’t leave me after hearing the confession.” Chike said to Chidiogo when they started eating. She lifted her eyes at the same time he lifted his and they were looking at each other eyeball to eyeball, but with much love. Chidiogo was not sure what it was that Chike wanted to confess, but she very much liked to hear it. “I have to hear the confession first. I love you, but I can’t promise not to leave you. What if you have impregnated another woman? That means I will certainly leave you.” Chidiogo joked as they laughed romantically. “My name is not Chike and I’m not a staff of Authority Bank. Also, I’m not Igbo.” His words sounded like a joke, but at the same time, they flew past Chidiogo’s ears like a cacophony of loud gunshots. “What do you mean? Is this a bad joke?” Chidiogo asked. She dropped her spoon and paid close attention to Chike who was chewing a scoop of rice and stew. It was a very tensed moment for the lovers. “I’m very serious. My name is Terry and I’m Tiv from Benue state. I’m an investigative spy working with the Intelligence Agency, the same agency you work for. I was assigned to investigate the fraud at the Authority Bank. But because it was complicated and risky, I had to pose as a staff member. The bank employed me without knowing.” Chike said. He had his eyes fixed on Chidiogo so as to see her reaction. At that point, Chidiogo had stopped eating completely. She stood up and sat at the edge of the chair looking very surprised. “So why didn’t you tell me? Why are you just telling me this? Why did you lie to me all this while?”” Chidiogo was furious. “I’m sorry Chidiogo. It (truncated)",,['malaria'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0cb9640e-61ab-4fdf-903d-b3e89331f657,reviewed,"Anytime there is an action that involves selection, there is also a counter-action that involves rejection. For example, if you select people to be ministers, it would invariably mean that you reject others for that position. And when you apportion portfolios to them, some will be chosen to man what has come to be known as first-class ministries, such as Finance, petroleum, Defence, Transport, Aviation, and Foreign Affairs, which implies that those who did not get such juicy ministries were rejected. It is in light of this that Nigerians ought to take some of the criticism of first the choice of ministers and then their choices of portfolios. A minister is not a specialist. A minister is an administrator. That is why each ministry has a Permanent Secretary, who is a specialist, as the civil service head of that ministry. And in the hierarchy, there are Directors, Heads of Departments and senior civil servants, who are micromanagers of specific niches within that ministry. The job of a minister is to give direction. In other words, to lead. The position of the civil servants is to garner the skill and management required to move in the direction they have been led by their minister. You do not even need to be a doctor to be the Minister for Health. The only ministry that Constitutionally requires specialisation is the Ministry of Justice. And if that ministry was not tied to the office of the Attorney General, then even that specialisation would not be necessary. For example, the UK's Health Minister is the Rt Hon Steve Barclay MP. The fellow is a lawyer and former soldier. However, he has built a reputation in the health ministry as an effective administrator par excellence, who has prevented the UK from seeing a resurgence in the new strain of COVID and meeting his targets to reduce the cost and waiting time for cancer patients, and addressing funding issues in the NHS. In the United States, their Health Minister is Xavier Becerra, who is also a lawyer and career politician who served as Attorney General of California. Mr Becerra handled the US Monkey Pox outbreak and contained it. So we must understand the difference between leadership and management. Aliko Dangote leads the Dangote Group, and he has built the world's largest single-train refinery in Lagos. However, he is not managing that facility because he does not have the expertise to do so. He has thus hired people with the requisite expertise to manage that aspect of his business and report to him. Otunba Mike Adenuga is perhaps Nigeria's most brilliant industrialist. However, it is his leadership that has brought him thus far. He is one of Africa's leading, if not the continent's top telecommunications mogul. But he does not need to understand how a submarine cable makes the Glo network one of Africa's best. He has managers who understand that and report to him. A leader that is bogged down with micromanagement cannot be effective. That is why Buhari failed. Because he left his job of leadership to be chasing small fry who stole $25,000, instead of delegating that to Bawa, without 'snoopervising' him. If you look at the Naira, it was most stable between 1975 and 1979 when it traded at 64 kobo to $1. And for two of those years, the Governor of the Central Bank was Adamu Ciroma, a journalist who read history. Ciroma was a leader. He led a CBN Board of Directors and Committee of Governors that had people with the technical skills to move in the direction he wanted to go. So, please, let's put things into proper perspective.

d2a8ed94-c71a-4056-b0e7-64e6435286b2,reviewed,"DOES KILLING NIGERIEN BABIES BRING GLORY TO OUR NAME? A dear and respected friend of mine who was once our Ambassador to a European country, who has relatives and strong links in and with Niger Republic and who is well versed in security and intelligence matters told me that up to 40 babies are dying each day in Niger as a consequence of our cutting off electricty supplies to them. According to him these babies die in hospitals and incubators across the country as a consequence of the fact that there is no electricty supply and there is no fuel to power their generators. This was confirmed by one Dr. Abdoul Djibou, a Nigerien medical practitioner, in an interview with Newsonlineng.com. They wrote, ""According to a source in Niger Republic, Dr. Abdoul Djibou, there has been reports from Dosso Regional Hospital and Cominak Hospital about the recent spike in infant mortality. According to him, over 40 babies die daily in Niger since the Nigerian government cutoff Electricity supply to Niger and also closed its borders. It has affected hospital badly as they’re unable to power their incubators and other life supporting equipment to assist these babies. He also mentioned that the closed borders has made it nearly impossible for hospitals to access petroleum products especially Diesel and Petrol to power their plants and generators. This is aside the untold hardships that the general populace are grasping with in Niger. He has made a passionate appeal for the Nigerian government to reconsider its decision even though backed by the ECOWAS. He stressed the need for the Nigerian government to remember that the people of Niger are more like an extension of northern Nigeria. In his opinion, he believed strongly that the ongoing negotiations with the Junta leaders will yield results and stressed the need for the negotiations to be intensified instead of beating the drums of war and upholding the current stiff sanctions that has now crippled the economy and the health sector especially"" (Nigeronlineeng.com: Coup Sanctions On Niger Republic Causes Untold Hardship/Starvation/Death). I cannot possibly confirm the veracity or accuracy of these assertions and reports but if they are anywhere near the truth it is enough to prick anyone's conscience. Furthermore I doubt that our President, being a humane, rational and reasonable leader, would have allowed this to happen if he was aware of the harsh and cruel consequences of the ""cut off all electricity to Niger"" policy and that is precisely why it is important to bring it to his attention in this article. Quite apart from that, according to UNICEF, ""more than two million children have been affected by the crisis and are in desperate need of humanitarian assistance"" and millions of dollars worth of vaccines for polio and other dangerous diseses cannot be safely preserved or stored due to power outages. On its own part Africanews.com reports that ""The U.N. is spending over 20 times more money than usual on fuel for generators to keep millions of vaccines in Niger from spoiling due to incessant power cuts. The outages are the result of severe economic and travel sanctions imposed by regional countries after mutinous soldiers toppled the country's president last month Country representative for the United Nations Children´s Fund in Niger, Stefano Savi, said it has spent $200,000 powering generators to keep vaccines, including for polio and rotavirus, across the country cold during the first three weeks of August. That's up from approximately $10,000 a month previously and might soon run out of money, he said. Niger relies on neighboring Nigeria for up to 90% of its power, but after soldiers ousted democratically elected President Mohamed Bazoum in July, Nigeria cut off part of its electricity supply as part of sanctions imposed by the West African regional bloc, ECOWAS. The sanctions are taking a toll on the population with the price of goods rising, residents unable to easily access cash, and people living in the dark. Now there are mounting concerns it will gravely impact the health system, particularly the ability to keep some 28 million vaccine doses in the country cold. Although there were power cuts before the sanctions, they usually lasted a few hours, but now the cuts are much longer - sometimes up to 18 hours a day, said Savi. UNICEF only has enough money until the end of August and is appealing to donors for emergency funds, he said."" How can we as a nation inflict such damage and unleash such wickedness and misfortune on innocent people who live just across the border from us and who are essentially our people too? This is unacceptable and especially so given the fact that we are not at war with Niger and the overwhelming majority of our people regard them as our brothers. This begs the question: is this the way to treat our African neighbours and brothers even whilst we lay claim to seeking and preferring a diplomatic solution to the crisis? Methinks not!

133ed47a-7087-4827-91e7-eff2485e56df,archived,"Last Flight to Dubai Episode Four (Final battles) “I want to go to the hospital to run some tests. My body is feeling somehow since we returned from Dubai.” Chidiogo said to Chike that Friday morning when both of them were preparing to go out. They had slept together the night before. Chike was preparing to go to Authority Bank where the board of directors is waiting for him to present the result of his investigation into the N3 billion fraud. “What exactly is happening to you? I notice you sleep a lot lately and you appear to be weak. Are you sure you don’t have malaria? Anyway, it is good that you are going to run some tests, so we will know what it is.” Chike responded. They both kissed and departed the house. Deep down her heart, Chidiogo was very scared about going to the hospital and she knew it might not be malaria. Besides, her period has been delayed by four days now, so she wasn’t sure what was happening to her body, but the tests will confirm. Meanwhile, Chike arrived at Authority Bank and he was ushered into the conference hall and led to the podium so he could address the board. The hall was packed full with everyone that matters at the Authority Bank. Stern-looking policemen and security lurked around the vicinity as if on a special mission. Mr Achibong was present and he was seated at the front row. Chike lifted his head from the podium to start speaking and his eyes ‘jammed’ with those of Mr Achibong, but he ignored him and went ahead with his presentation. “Good morning everyone. I would like to go straight to the report without wasting our time. I will also present just the summary of the report and then make copies available for those who wish to read further.” Chike started. His voice sounded very confident. “The investigation I carried out almost took my life, but God intervened.” He said. Everyone in the hall muttered some sounds as if in confirmation of what he just said. Mr Achibong had his left hand wedging his chin as he listened with rapt attention like a student. “My investigation revealed that the CEO of Authority Bank by the name, Mr Achibong runs an international drug business and he also controls a cartel of internet fraudsters. The N3 billion fraud which was averted by me at the Authority Bank did not just happen. Mr Achibong gave out the banking details of high-profiled customers to his cartel of hackers and they successfully moved the funds to an account he created. Thankfully, the account has been frozen.” Chike said. The hall by then went dead with silence. Everyone looked in the direction where Mr Achibong was seated. “That is pretty much the report. The only thing I have to add is that Mr Achibong transferred me to Dubai and ordered his boys to eliminate me because of the content of this report. But here we are today. I will spare you the complicated details of the investigation and just hand that over to the police to aid their prosecution of the suspects. Thank you for the trust invested in me.” Chike said. As soon as he was done, security men stormed the hall and arrested Mr Achibong and whisked him away. Chike was very tired when he returned from the Authority bank to meet Chidiogo who was already back from the hospital. He took two hours to sleep and rest his head. And then he came down to eat lunch prepared by Chidiogo. “I have a confession to make. And please, don’t leave me after hearing the confession.” Chike said to Chidiogo when they started eating. She lifted her eyes at the same time he lifted his and they were looking at each other eyeball to eyeball, but with much love. Chidiogo was not sure what it was that Chike wanted to confess, but she very much liked to hear it. “I have to hear the confession first. I love you, but I can’t promise not to leave you. What if you have impregnated another woman? That means I will certainly leave you.” Chidiogo joked as they laughed romantically. “My name is not Chike and I’m not a staff of Authority Bank. Also, I’m not Igbo.” His words sounded like a joke, but at the same time, they flew past Chidiogo’s ears like a cacophony of loud gunshots. “What do you mean? Is this a bad joke?” Chidiogo asked. She dropped her spoon and paid close attention to Chike who was chewing a scoop of rice and stew. It was a very tensed moment for the lovers. “I’m very serious. My name is Terry and I’m Tiv from Benue state. I’m an investigative spy working with the Intelligence Agency, the same agency you work for. I was assigned to investigate the fraud at the Authority Bank. But because it was complicated and risky, I had to pose as a staff member. The bank employed me without knowing.” Chike said. He had his eyes fixed on Chidiogo so as to see her reaction. At that point, Chidiogo had stopped eating completely. She stood up and sat at the edge of the chair looking very surprised. “So why didn’t you tell me? Why are you just telling me this? Why did you lie to me all this while?”” Chidiogo was furious. “I’m sorry Chidiogo. It (truncated)",,['malaria'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My name is Tony, I am a very handsome promising young man who has a lot of aspirations and dreams. I am the only son of my father. Now here is my story I lived with my father alone after my mothers death in a small town in the eastern part of Nigeria. Everyone around me loved me because of my intelligent and charisma. We are not rich, but we don’t starve…yes,But even as we don’t starve which is the most important thing,I was still not happy and contented. I wanted more,I wanted to own a lot of things including good foods;at least better than the normal yams,beans and rice we ate on a daily bases..I wanted varieties. I am the type of guy who like enjoyment,I love good foods and good life. I forgot to mention,I am a graduate from a reputable university in Nigeria and I made second class upper degree,yet I was jobless. My father sold one from the only two lands he had just to see me through the university,that was the promise he made to my late mother on her sick bed;he assured her that their only child must be a graduate and a successful man. My mother died when I was just a teenager, I had no idea life without a mother would be so difficult but I had to adjust,at least for my father. This added to my frustrations and made me a terrible murmurer, i murmured and hissed like a woman; tufiakwa… sometimes it annoys me seeing myself display those women traits but I didn’t care to change at all,after all god did not create murmuring for only women…I hated the fact that some of my friends were big boys in town and I was at home eating papa thanks sir,did you remain small? I always ask God every morning “God I’m I a chair ??? Like I feel frustrated more in the mornings,I guess my anger doesn’t like morning because I don’t feel so angry at night;I feel happy going to my bed every night but I always wake up with a terrible anger the next day,just like PEAK,anger is in me.. “Life is a misery and it is beyond what you see or think you know” that was my father’s favorite words to me anytime I talk off point as he fondly referred to those my rants. One morning,I knelt down for the very first time to pray to God as I woke up, I was praying in Queens English and my voice sounded like Celine Dion, chaii..if not for one thing I would have entered studio that day meennn,fine boy with fine voice,I praised myself, but I felt God was not hearing my prayers I then decided to humble myself and prayed in pidgin English ;”God abeg na,abeg abeg ..help me na die I Dey…abeg please biko God,but nothing happened…my prayers were not answered, I was disappointed that my prayers were delaying. I wanted God to answer me immediately even though in my mind I knew I prayed rubbish. On that Saturday morning, I was lamenting as usual because we were having yam porridge for breakfast,my father woke up early enough just to prepare that meal but instead of appreciating his efforts and strength I condemned the food as always… I threatened my father that nothing would make me eat that rubbish in the kitchen..my father looked at me in dismay and looked up to heaven,then asked God “where did he get this boy from and sent to him as a son…. I became more angry,the way I get angry eh can be studied in the university as a course. I can stand for hours hissing and murmuring,since I am jobless I can proudly say murmuring is what I do for a living.Any day I don’t whine,hiss and murmur in the house, my father will think I am dying and he would go to the chemist close to our house to get me some Malaria and Typhoid drugs and force me to take them. In his words,a living dog is better than a dead lion… My father went ahead to dish his own Yam porridge since I refused to eat..well I didn’t care. I had this friend that I was so close to,we call each other brother,he was more than a friend to me. We visited each other’s house and do a lot of things together. I always complained to him and he has tried severely to help my situation…on that faithful day he brought some news as usual, and I wish I could turn back the hands of time and not listen to him…but unfortunately, it was too late.

International Youth Day; President Tinubu broke the jinx Appoints A 36 Years old Nigerian Youth as Minister, Youngest Minister in the the History of 4th Republic of Nigeria. President Bola Tinubu in July nominated Dr Betta Edu from Cross River State to serve as part of his cabinet as a Minister of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Beyond signifying the President as a man of his words on the inclusion of Women and Youths in his administration, Betta’s appointment as a member of the team to pilot the affairs of the nation, is a demonstration of the President’s Resolve to get qualified, properly schooled, persons of great character and integrity, persons who are committed to the development of the Country on board. The youngest of all the nominees, The Medical Doctor and Phd holder represents the ideal youth today, she has kept the dreams hopes and aspirations of the Nigerian youth alive; “ The Nigeria Dream”. Nigerian Youth must understudy and emulate this young woman. Her quick acceleration, growth and progress in under 8 years from a Special Adviser to Director General Of cross River State Primary Health care Development Agency, to Commissioner, to Chairman of all Commissioners of Health in Nigeria and then the Youngest National Woman Leader of any Political Party in Africa and now a Confirmed Minister of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, can only be achieved by hard work, focus, humility and trust in God while contributing immensely to the development of her country. Like Betta, the youths today should know they can do better. The must see opportunities in every situation and be ready to whether the storms. Remember there is a price to pay for success. The must bring value and proper solutions to the problem we face in our nation rather than seek who to blame. Her track record of achievements precedes her. She was appointed the youngest Special Adviser in Nigeria at the time and became the Youngest Director General of Cross River Primary Health Development Agency, where she excelled so well, she was eventually made the Commissioner of Health in the State, as well as been the Chairman,CRS COVID-19 taskforce where she delivered as well. Recognising her capacity would be required for National Development, beyond her state, Dr Betta emerged again the youngest National Woman Leader of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). Today she is the youngest Presidential nominee as a Minister of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, which really comes as no surprise as her capacity to deliver is not in doubt. It is to be noted that she is the first female Minister from Cross River. This equally opens the space for more female involvement in politics in her state. Betta has given a chance to the younger ones to make them realize the potential they can maximize if they truly put their hearts and minds in it. She is a brand in Cross River and the Country at large, people should realize that anyone can do better. She came from a very humble background, but she is one of those that has sent a lesson to the younger generation that they too could strive to that level she is through hard work and determination. She has always given her best in any capacity she found herself and has achieved greatness. Excuse and impossibility doesn’t exist in her dictionary, a goal getter with a positive mind set. She did not replace her beauty and smiles with the need to build intellectual capacity. In her words “ I wish to be known for the value I bring to the table, beauty is vain” The President did not make a mistake to have brought her. She is celebrated at home and across the country as a shining example of what is expected of Nigerian youths in the country today. Capacity like what Betta has delivered is what is required to take the country out of the doldrums, her appointment by President Tinubu, is putting a square peg in a square hole. Hope is indeed Renewed for the Nigerian Youth. | HAPPY INTERNATIONAL YOUTHDAY BELIEVE IN YOURSELF THE WORLD WILL BE AT YOUR FEET From DR.

While other centres are to be upgraded to increase accessibility, decrease travel time to these facilities and reduce overcrowding in densely populated centres. Additionally, fifteen percent of the state’s annual budget will be allocated to the provision of healthcare services to the people of Kaduna state . Governor Sani disclosed these interventions while hosting a delegation from the Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Muhammad Sa'ad Abubakar III, represented by the Emir of Argungu, National Primary Healthcare Development Agency (NPHCDA), World Health Organization(WHO),UNICEF and other key stakeholders at the Government House,Kaduna. The delegation was in Kaduna as part of an advocacy visit to discuss critical matters concerning public health and primary healthcare in Kaduna State. In his remarks Governor Sani disclosed some health statistics that needed urgent interventions such as the neo-natal mortality rates and the outbreak of diseases like diphtheria,measles and polio. “The government will control and prevent these viruses, by improving the health indices in the State and strengthening primary healthcare centers. Additionally,the Kaduna State Contributory Health Insurance Scheme has embarked on a massive enrollment drive to get more residents to access healthcare services at subsidized rates” In his response Dr. Faisal Shuaib, the Executive Director/CEO of NPHCDA, lauded the Governor for his inclusive policies targeting the most vulnerable groups and ensuring they are covered by primary healthcare. He added that the NPHCDA as an agency is also collaborating with traditional institutions to ensure universal health coverage.

2f89f75b-47e4-4498-bc71-854995ad0685,needsReview,"TRUE LIFE STORY OF MIN. VICTORIA ORENZE. While growing up, I was very stubborn. I am always fighting with every person. People look at me and ask, are you the one fighting, I said yes. As small as I am, I fight people. I get so angry easily. The Spirit of anger takes over me that when people are talking or doing nonsense around me, I don't talk back, I just look for something and stabb the person. I don't have the time exchanging words of abuse with people because in my mind, I reason in a way that if you can not beat me, why are you opening your mouth to talk to me. Anger took over me that if you are talking to me then, I will be quiet because I don't know how to talk back at people, all I want is to do something crazy to the person fighting me, get you off the floor and beat life out of such person and after the fight, people get afraid of me. That was the kind of life I use to live before. God has called me into a Spiritual battle but I was ignorant fighting physical battles. I was fighting physical war, fighting and exchanging blows with people.Not just with women, with guys... You don't say because you are a man, you can just talk to me anyhow...I fight you for it. Thank God for my mother, she's a spiritual person God put in my life. She said remember God called you... For some who have seen the story in Youtube.. I received the call of God and also gave my heart to Jesus Christ at the age of 9years old. My mom who has seen the call of God in my life said to me that if I go on like this, I will not get to where God want me to be. She said if I go on with this kind of life of anger, I will not fulfill destiny. My mom then prayed a prayer,I don't know if to call it a prayer or a curse, but my mom made a prayer and said she is going to tell the Lord that anytime I get angry, that the Lord should flog me""Olorun ma nae legba"" translated in Yoruba. She said God will deal with me anytime I get angry.. I actually overlooked it like it was meaningless but guess what? Everytime I get angry , I literarily fall sick. You will think something is wrong with me like i have malaria or something else. I will be shivering. It happened the first time time I thought it was normal until it continued...after sometime, I decided to borrow myself some brain. (I helped my thinking faculty ). That prayer was said so that I don't miss it in life...so that I can fulfill the destiny God had planned for me. So that I will do the things I am doing now. If the Lord didn't helped me I won't be doing what am doing now. If the Lord didn't help me, you will not be blessed by anything am doing now. If the Lord didn't do that Spiritual surgery, that flogging, I will not be here today. I will not be a blessing to thousands. If God has called you Globally, locally and you have the call of God upon your life, a surgery needs to happen in you where you old life dies and you take up the new life of God. In the name of Jesus, the Lord will perform a surgery that takes away your weakness and hindrances to destiny fulfillment in the name of Jesus!!!

I was advising women that can't practice natural family planning to go for artificial family planning instead of risking their lives giving birth every year. Here's my reply to the comment 👇 Joseph Wilson family planning is just like any other drugs that have possible side effects. If you start checking possible side effects of any drug you buy, you will end up not taking them to cure your sickness because of the possible side effects. Even simple paracetamol has many side effects. Just like antimalarial drugs that have different brands and combinations like arthemether, lumenfantrin, quinine, amodiaquine etc. So, is different methods of family planning. If a doctor gives a patient quinine and the adverse reaction becomes too much more than the malaria it was meant to cure, the doctor switches to another make that will go well with the patient's body. Same is different family planning. If a woman starts experiencing much effects from a particular one she is using, she doesn't have to continue with it. She goes back and the doctor changes another one that will be suitable for her. It can rarely reach to a stage of killing the woman except she stubbornly continues with it even when she knows that it doesn't go well with her body. Natural family planning is the best without side effects but very difficult to practice because most women can't identify their fertile period and even those that do, some husbands wouldn't take No for an answer once they need sex. So, that's why i said if you can't go with natural, don't die giving birth every year but go for artificial family planning | 3:37 PM 4G 0.00 B/S 95 Know Your Body As a...

f5abe190-59d6-44f7-95df-382325448ab1,needsReview,""" I am 37 years old. Not properly married, but I have 4 children. I got pregnant for the man I call my husband, and had to move in with him because I didn't have a choice. My family couldn't bear the shame of me giving birth in their house. We started living together. I had my first child and was expecting my husband to do the right thing by going to see my parents, but he kept on postponing with the excuse of not having money. I remained hopeful, praying for things to change for the better for him. I got prégnant again and had our second child and before long, I had the third child. It was after then I decided I wasn't going to have anymore children because of what I was going through already. He constantly tells me how worthless I am and that he has a girlfriend that makes him happy. He also tells me that he will bring in another woman, and if he should bring in another woman, what then will be my position? He humiliates me in front of my children constantly. He is rarely home. Whenever he is around, he won't stop abüsing me verbally though he rarely hit me physically. I had to endure all of this because I couldn't do anything, I don't have the capacity to take care of 3 children alone. When Covid came, everyone was forced to stay at home, and then I got pregnant the fourth time. Last year, my husband left the country to work in another country. He sends money for the well-being of his children and I've also found something to do to support. My worry still remains that till date he has not paid my brideprice, which means he has not married me properly. He was supposed to do that before he travelled but he kept bringing up excuses. Right now, I do not know my stand and the only reason I'm still here is my children, I can't take care of them alone.""

dc0d2d89-2523-4d2b-9189-bcef36d21065,needsReview,"Anytime there is an action that involves selection, there is also a counter-action that involves rejection. For example, if you select people to be ministers, it would invariably mean that you reject others for that position. And when you apportion portfolios to them, some will be chosen to man what has come to be known as first-class ministries, such as Finance, petroleum, Defence, Transport, Aviation, and Foreign Affairs, which implies that those who did not get such juicy ministries were rejected. It is in light of this that Nigerians ought to take some of the criticism of first the choice of ministers and then their choices of portfolios. A minister is not a specialist. A minister is an administrator. That is why each ministry has a Permanent Secretary, who is a specialist, as the civil service head of that ministry. And in the hierarchy, there are Directors, Heads of Departments and senior civil servants, who are micromanagers of specific niches within that ministry. The job of a minister is to give direction. In other words, to lead. The position of the civil servants is to garner the skill and management required to move in the direction they have been led by their minister. You do not even need to be a doctor to be the Minister for Health. The only ministry that Constitutionally requires specialisation is the Ministry of Justice. And if that ministry was not tied to the office of the Attorney General, then even that specialisation would not be necessary. For example, the UK's Health Minister is the Rt Hon Steve Barclay MP. The fellow is a lawyer and former soldier. However, he has built a reputation in the health ministry as an effective administrator par excellence, who has prevented the UK from seeing a resurgence in the new strain of COVID and meeting his targets to reduce the cost and waiting time for cancer patients, and addressing funding issues in the NHS. In the United States, their Health Minister is Xavier Becerra, who is also a lawyer and career politician who served as Attorney General of California. Mr Becerra handled the US Monkey Pox outbreak and contained it. So we must understand the difference between leadership and management. Aliko Dangote leads the Dangote Group, and he has built the world's largest single-train refinery in Lagos. However, he is not managing that facility because he does not have the expertise to do so. He has thus hired people with the requisite expertise to manage that aspect of his business and report to him. Otunba Mike Adenuga is perhaps Nigeria's most brilliant industrialist. However, it is his leadership that has brought him thus far. He is one of Africa's leading, if not the continent's top telecommunications mogul. But he does not need to understand how a submarine cable makes the Glo network one of Africa's best. He has managers who understand that and report to him. A leader that is bogged down with micromanagement cannot be effective. That is why Buhari failed. Because he left his job of leadership to be chasing small fry who stole $25,000, instead of delegating that to Bawa, without 'snoopervising' him. If you look at the Naira, it was most stable between 1975 and 1979 when it traded at 64 kobo to $1. And for two of those years, the Governor of the Central Bank was Adamu Ciroma, a journalist who read history. Ciroma was a leader. He led a CBN Board of Directors and Committee of Governors that had people with the technical skills to move in the direction he wanted to go. So, please, let's put things into proper perspective.

Paying a heavy price to see Pastors succeed. The Pastor of liberty church London shared some powerful indices. He said according to research 30% of church started fail and close up after 4 years. He also said that 30% - 40% of churches in America disappeared after COVID. Recently, we are now hearing about Pastor commiting suicide. The most attacked and unappreciated set of people in the world today are Pastors. A pastor is expected to be available at all times in the life of his congregants. Child birth, child dedication, child in hospital, child graduation, child matriculation, child wedding, marriage crises, member in police net, member hospitalized, member loss of Job, member demonic attack, members relations death, members death & burial. The list goes on and on. Every Sunday people congregate to listen to the pastor with high expectation that the pastor should touch my case. Those emotionally wounded or whose boy friend broke their heart, those looking for jobs and contract, those trusting God for a life partner, those who want financially break through, those sick, those hungry for more of God, those in police or court case, those in debt etc. The pastor must minister to our spirit, soul, body, career, family, marriage, social life, mental, emotional, financial, destiny, spiritual, business , relational, political etc. There are more to say but let me stop here. But no one cares to know what about Pastor. Pastor is human and has his own challenges. Pastor has a family, he has quarrels with his wife, disappointments from members, his friends, relations and even his children. Pastor is a target for demonic attacks by witches, wizard, demonic forces, the devil and the occult. Pastor has health issues, emotional needs and financial needs. Pastor has to pay house rent, school fees, his wife and extended family look up to him. Church member also look up to him for their needs. Pastor has all these on him, Pastor can't be sick, tired or weak. Pastor can't be eating, he is supposed to be fasting. Pastor can't fall into temptation, he is the standard. We will not forgive him, we must disgrace him. Pastor here, Pastor there. Aaaahaaaaaaa!!!! Please help your Pastor. Pray for your pastor. Send his a text of encouragement. Send him credit for his phone. Visit him with food stuffs. Pay for his DSTV. Encourage him, tell him how much you love him and appreciate him for his sacrifices. Send him money for launch. Surprise him with a mind blowing gift. Let him recieved an alert that strengthens his heart to keep fighting. I am a Pastor, I have Pastors visit me weeping in pain. Wanting to give up. It is a lot. Let us keep our Pastors Strong. Families will crumble without them. Marriages will fail without them. Destiny will be destroyed without them. The devil will have a free day without them. They do the work of educationist, doctors, phycologists, entrepreneurs, coaches, nutritionist etc. The church is now the most effective education center in Africa. Celebrate your pastor today. Put his picture on your status and do as I instructed earlier. God bless my Pastor Apostle Joshua Selman and Mama kay Akighbe II, thank you for the sacrifices. I love you sir & ma. I hope this blessed you. Pastor Iyke Oyeka",,['covid-19'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Anuj and Maaya get anxious recalling Maaya kissing Anuj and requesting not to inform Anupama about it as Anupama will misunderstand. Anuj says Maaya doesn’t want him to inform her what happened during picnic. Kavya asks Vanraj if he remembers what he told about his wife to his ex-wife? Vanraj stands with bent head. Kavya says he told he is not happy with Kavya, he hasn’t progressed after marrying her, and he finds peace with Anupama instead. She tells Hasmukh that he spoke a lot more against her. She asks Vanraj how could he speak like that; if he thinks she doesn’t fit in his Hum Saath Saath Hain type family, then she will not put any effort at all; he is so selfish that he wants Anupama back in his life and its good that Anupama gave him a strict warning. Vanraj says she misunderstood. Kavya says her misunderstanding cleared instead, Anupama was right that he can’t be of any one woman. Anuj lies to Anupama that Little Anu ate lots of chocolates and slept without brushing her teeth, he was hiding it from her. Anupama relaxes and says is it. Maaya says she was asking him to hide about it and asks let us go in. Anuj hugs Anupama tightly and feels guilty for lying. Maaya feels jealous seeing that via car mirror. Anuj asks Anupama if she is fine. She says yes and asks what about him. He says hmm and asks about Toshu. She says he is fine and says recalling Vanraj’s words says she wants to tell him something. Maaya purposefully interferes in lieu of getting her bag from car. Anuj holds Anupama’s hand and walks inside home, leaving Maaya more jealous. Kavya warns Vanraj that he destroyed to whatever extent he could and shouldn’t dare try to interfere in her life even by mistake. She seeks Hasmukh’s blessings for her new job and says neither she nor Anirudh are doing anything wrong. She warns Vanraj that he can think whatever he wants to, she will not stop or listen to his nonsense again, enough of respect now. Anupama offers cookies to Little Anu. Little Anu thanks her and says these are her favorite cookies. Anupama says her bebli/Little Anu is her favorite cookie and asks what did she do in picnic. Little Anu says they played games, sang songs, danced, and clicked lots of pictures. Anupama asks Maaya if Little Anu troubled her. Maaya says not at all. Anupama then notices Anuj’s hand injury with Maaya’s sari bandage over it. Anuj says its just a small injury. Maaya says organizers couldn’t arrange a doctor and Anuj was bleeding profusely, so she tied her sari bandage over his wound. Anuj says he is fine. Maaya says he will catch infection and should take tetanus injection. Anupama notices her change in behavior towards Anuj. Anuj goes to change. Kavya at a cafeteria with Anirudh sips a hot coffee and feels its burn. Anirudh says be it situation or coffee, she should wait till it cools down. He says we cold have met here, then why did she call him to her hose. She says what should she say. He says she wanted show Vanraj. Kavya says more than that, she wanted Vanraj to realize that when he can bring his ex home, even she can. He says basically she just used him. She tries to speak. He says he is joking, he feels good to meet her and knows how a jealous husband feels as even he was a jealous husband once, but to make someone jelouss, they themselves have to burn from within; even she would have felt bad trying make Vanraj jealous. Kavya says he was madly in love with Vanraj. Anuj walks to his room and recalls the incident again. Maaya thinks Anupama will question Anuj for sure and after learning truth, she will not let Maaya stay for even 15 days; she hopes Anuj doesn’t say anything. Anuj continues to feel guilty. Anupama hugs him from behind. Kavya tells Anirudh says their relationship didn’t work as they both were at mistake, she didn’t want to repeat that mistake with Vanraj and tried her best, but Vanraj has completely changed and is not like before. Anirudh says life before and after marriage won’t be the same, they usually ignore red flags when they are in girlfriend-boyfriend zone and those red flags bother them after marriage, Vanraj’s biggest problem is he is super egoistic. Kavya says even she has defects in her. Anuj tells Anupama that he missed her a lot. Anupama says even she did. He says not more than that as he had left his life at home. Anupama says a lot happens in a day. They both at once say they want to say something. Maaya thinks she doesn’t know what they must be talking, shall she barge into their room. Anirudh suggests Kavya to save her relationship with the best effort she can, but if things get ot of her control and she is not happy in this relationship, she should get out of it and give more preference to herself instead of suffocating in it. Kavya asks if he wants to say something else. Anirudh says she shouldn’t get him wrong, they can start afresh, he is sure that (truncated)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DATE: SATURDAY, 02 SEPTEMBER, 2023 TOPIC: BE MINDFUL OF YOUR ASSOCIATION SCRIPTURE: He that walketh with wise men shall be wise: but a companion of fools shall be destroyed. Proverbs 13:20. THOUGHT FOR THE DAY: The quality of your company determines the quality of your destiny. In life, I have discovered that association defines destination. Company affects outcome. The quality of your company determines the quality of your destiny. I heard a story some time ago. A young lady, who was a virgin, went to see a medical doctor, and the doctor told her, “How can you still be a virgin at this age of yours? If you don’t sleep with men, you will get sick?” That must be a demonic medical doctor circulating an evil theory. By the Grace of God, I am a medical doctor and I want you to know that nothing like that has been medically proven. So, following the counsel of this medical doctor, the lady ignorantly and foolishly handed herself to a man who had a carnal knowledge of her. The most painful and regrettable thing was, at her first attempt at committing immorality, she got infected with HIV. The man did not only have immorality with her but also gave her HIV. What a tragedy! Beloved, you must be very careful of the people whose instructions you follow. You must be very careful of the people who speak into your life. Just like this lady, someone may attempt to smoke for the first time because of a counsel from a friend. Someone may decide to take alcohol for the first time because of a counsel from a friend. There are people in prison today because of the friends they associate with. You must know that friendship is not by force; friendship is by choice. Do not let anyone force themselves on you, and do not force yourself on anyone. Love is a command, but relationship or friendship is a choice. Even though we are commanded to love everyone, we are not commanded to make everyone our friend. So, love liberally but relate selectively. Love everyone but select your friends because your association determines your future. REMEMBER THIS: The quality of your company determines the quality of your destiny. ASSIGNMENTS: 1. Love liberally, but relate selectively. Be mindful of the people you associate with. 2. Disengage from every relationship or friendship that has a negative influence on you. 3. Always get a second opinion if you receive a dubious counsel such as the type the lady received. PRAYER: Lord, I receive the grace to disengage from any toxic friendship I am currently engaged in. I ask that You give me the right association for destiny fulfilment, Lord, in Jesus’ Name. FOR FURTER UNDERSTANDING, GET THIS MESSAGE: Fulfilling Destiny (Part 2). QUOTE: Who surrounds you determines what you can survive. It is a matter of association. Culled from the book “15 Kingdom Strategies For Survival” Dr Paul Enenche. DAILY READING: Ezekiel 25-27.

Your father and your mother are not immortals; at least, not in this life. Don't wait until you become as wealthy as Elon Musk before you will start taking care of them. Don't say, ""when I make it in this life, I will change their lives;"" start now with the little you have to change their lives for good. Tomorrow is not promised, not for you and not for them. Gift them what you can afford now before their lives or even yours folds up. Don't wait until you can buy them a car before you can show them that you appreciated all that love they showed to you; buy them what you can afford now even if it is a carton of spaghetti, a packet of macaroni or even of malaria drugs when they are down with malaria. Gifting your parents a carton of noodles when they are alive is far more better than spending billions for them when they die, even when they had no food to eat while they lived. You don't honour a man who died of hunger by making food surplus during his burial; give your parents a befitting life, not a befitting burial. Be their retirement plan, not their interment plan. Don't watch from afar as they struggle with ill-health and you do nothing, but once they kick the bucket , you show up with buckets of dollars in order to give them a befitting burial ceremony. Tomorrow is not promised for any one of us; shower them with love, care and attention, not with your empty buckets of crocodile tears when they die. They mustn't enjoy your money under the canopy while lying in a coffin; give it to them now. Call your parents regularly and not once in a blue moon. Don't forget their birthdays because it is through them that God gave you a brirthday. Celebrate them now, and don't wait for a time you will sycophantically mourn because they are no more. Convert the tears you will cry when they die into care and love now that they are alive. Don't despise and neglect them when life becomes tough for them because of age; it is a wickedness that God detest. If you won't make them leap for joy when they are alive, please don't weep when they die. Gift them the little things you have presently and don't postpone it to a time when you will give them the world even though they are no longer in the world. That little money in your hands mightn't mean much to you, but when it leaves your hands and finds its way into their hands, they will never forget it. Show them love now that they have health; if you don't, please, don't come beside me up hypocritically weep when they are no more. Do it more because tomorrow is not promised; not for you and not for them. Shalom! Your servant, @ Fr.

Because both parents died in the village, hunger step in. She has to travel from her village in Akwa ibom to port harcourt without knowing anyone in port harcourt. As she arrived port harcourt. No place to sleep. She has to start sleeping under bridge by Agip junction. That first night 2 young men raped her under the bridge with knife and she later became pregnant. So with her pregnancy, she kept on sleeping under the bridge with cold. One day GOD remembered her using Apostle chibuzor to rescue her with her pregnancy. After her rescue, she was taken to OPM free specialist hospital to register her for antenatal care . During her medical test it was discovered that she is HIV positive. Those boys has infected her. And her pregnancy was already 9 months and she has never visited any hospital before while she was sleeping under the bridge. So because she did not take any drug to prevent mother to child transmission, it was discovered her baby also has HIV. So today mother and daughter has been placed on antiretroviral drugs and they are doing very well. Many people don’t know that antiretroviral drugs ( HIV DRUGS ) are 100 % free in all government hospitals. Below picture is Apostle Chibuzor celebrating her daughters birthday. And she is getting healthy and healthy everyday. With prayers, drugs and good food I believe the HIV in blood will soon disappear.

He gave the charge on Wednesday August 30th, 2023 through ACE I Aisha Abubakar, Acting Zonal Commander, Kaduna Zonal Command during a one day sensitization programme tagged ""Workshop on Economic and Financial Crimes Reporting for Journalists"". While presenting his speech, she said that apart from denying victims of their hard earned Money the activities of these fraudsters will have a tendency to smear the image of our country which will discourage hard work and lawful engagements. While reiterating that the Commission remains committed and resolute in ensuring the fight against corruption is won at all levels, the Commission maintains that intensifying and harmonising efforts of all stakeholders in the anti-corruption fight is key to providing solutions to emerging trends in fraudulent practices. The Head, Media and Publicity, DCE Wilson Uwujaren described the media engagement as an avenue to strengthen collaborative ties with veritable stakeholders in order to collectively harness ideas of common interest towards the success of the anti-corruption fight. Hajia Asma'u Halilu, Chairperson of the Nigerian Union of Journalists, Kaduna State described the engagement as timely, comprehensive and dynamic such that they are better exposed to the activities of the Commission which will help them contribute effortlessly to the anti-corruption fight.

9fba09fb-fd14-4910-b7b9-a27968ba1e0f,needsReview,"Ways to protect yourself from liver problems (Liver Problems) Protecting yourself from liver problems is a must because the liver is one of the vital organs that govern human life. It filters the polluted chemicals from the body, controls the chemicals that the body needs and medicines for a person to live. Her work is extensive. Precautions to protect the liver from problems: 1. Avoid taking medicines without the advice of experts, and eat as they say. Example; Paracetamol is a fever and temperature/headache medication, controlled by the liver. When a person is safe drinking it every day illegally, it will be difficult for his liver, and it can cause him ""hepatotoxicity"" (severe damage to the liver). I made a video about that, I will post it in the comments. In the same way, taking traditional medicines that have not been proven to be effective and safe can cause liver problems. It is not wise to say that you should always take medicine for hemorrhoids, cold or male strength. 2. Avoid using sharp tools that others have used, for example; Needles/syringes, razors etc. There is inflammation of the liver (hepatitis), the most common. 3. Get vaccinated against hepatitis (hepatitis vaccine), doing so will protect you for at least 20 years or more. Because many people are carrying it with hepatitis without knowing it and some people are carrying it from their body. 4. Avoid drinking alcohol, from beer (beer/alcohol, no matter how harmful it is to the liver) to shisha, cough medicine (which some people drink). 5. Observe the condition of body weight/obesity; because too much fat causes fatty liver disease. 6. Avoid eating uncooked food (canned and sweet foods). Eat a diet rich in nutrients, vegetables/fruits. 7. Avoid intimate interactions with those who are not married (sex, kissing and hugging). Having sex with someone who has hepatitis can make a person infected, you see, having sex with someone who has sex outside of marriage can easily take it. So be careful, stick to only what is lawful. 8. Take care of physical and environmental hygiene, wash your hands often with water. 9. Exercise a lot to improve the health of the liver and the body as a whole. 10. Limit contact or entry where harmful chemicals (toxins and chemicals) are. 11. Going to the hospital for a health check-up from time to time. Know that a person's health depends on the health of his liver. Be very careful.

She is just about 23 years. Yesterday which was Sunday, I went to our neighbors house around 6pm to ask if I could use their oven. Their compound is not fenced so I just walked in straight to their backyard if I would see the man's wife. I overheard this girl making a call. Apparently she was the only one at home and she wasn't expecting anyone. She was asking the man over the fone who was sexualy better between his wife and her. My attention was arrested immediately. I stopped to hear more of the conversation. When I had enough, I made my presence known. She quickly hung up and tried to put up an innocent face. I also pretended like I heard nothing, I asked to use the oven and left . Getting back home, I was worried if that was my husband that girl was talking to, so I decided to find out. I got my husbands fone later that night and went through the call log. The time that girl was making that call was few minutes past 6. I checked my husbands fone and there was a number he called around that time. The number was not saved on the fone so I decided to call that number on my own fone and my true caller identified the number as ""Vicky hookup"". Guess what, the girls name is Victoria. I was surprised because I have the girls number saved on my fone. But I guess the number I have is for her family and friends. The one my husband has is for clients.

I got pregnant for the man I call my husband, and had to move in with him because I didn't have a choice. My family couldn't bear the shame of me giving birth in their house. We started living together. I had my first child and was expecting my husband to do the right thing by going to see my parents, but he kept on postponing with the excuse of not having money. I remained hopeful, praying for things to change for the better for him. I got pregnant again and had our second child and before long, I had the third child. It was after then I decided I wasn't going to have anymore children because of what I was going through already. He constantly tells me how worthless I am and that he has a girlfriend that makes him happy. He also tells me that he will bring in another woman, and if he should bring in another woman, what then will be my position? He humiliates me in front of my children constantly. He is rarely home. Whenever he is around, he won't stop abusing me verbally though he rarely hit me physically. I had to endure all of this because I couldn't do anything, I don't have the capacity to take care of 3 children alone. When Covid came, everyone was forced to stay at home, and then I got pregnant the fourth time. Last year, my husband left the country to work in another country. He sends money for the well-being of his children and I've also found something to do to support. My worry still remains that till date he has not paid my brideprice, which means he has not married me properly. He was supposed to do that before he travelled but he kept bringing up excuses.

The course was an elective course called HIV/AIDs and Narcotic Substances. As a Mass Communication student, I wondered why I had to study such a course, but all the same, no knowledge is a waste. I was very late to the lecture because it was initially difficult for me to locate the hall. UNILAG is such a large place and fresher like me easily got lost. It was one man in security uniform who later led me to the Hall F. I entered the hall when the lecturer was already rounding up his class. His name is Mr Ovirikpo. “Why are you just coming?” He asked me. Instantly, the whole class turned to look at me. I felt very stupid when I noticed that all eyes were on me. It was as if I was standing under a heavy rain without an umbrella. “I’m very sorry sir, but I got lost while looking for the lecture hall.” I said. I lifted my head up and looked directly at the lecturer while I explained myself. I also surveyed the whole class with a direct gaze. I didn’t want to appear timid and defenseless. “You missed your way? What a funny story! As if you are a kid in Ikeja market.” The lecturer mocked. The whole class laughed. Their laughter made me uncomfortable. If you have been ever been laughed at by your coursemates, you will understand what this meant. It is a very difficult thing to be laughed at while you stand in front of the class. “What are narcotic substances?” The lecturer asked. It was as if he wanted to punish me with the question. It was that moment when a teacher catches you making noise in his class and decides to punish you with a tough question. He wants you to fail so that he would prove that you were not listening to him. But fortunately for me, I’m intelligent and I knew the answer through and through. So, as the class laughed again, I also laughed at them in my mind. “Narcotic substances are drugs that produces analgesia, narcosis and that are easily addictive. That means they act as pain relievers and in many people, narcotics also produces a feeling of happiness or high level of elation. The most potent example is codeine.” I told the lecturer while looking at his eyes and also occasionally turning to look at the whole class. I knew the answer was correct and I knew I was attracting attention. I turned the embarrassing moment into my favour. “You see what I was saying. Someone who is just coming is even better than all of you who have been sitting here since the past hour.” The lecturer, Mr Ovirikpo said. He was clearly impressed. The whole class did not laugh again, but instead, they clapped for me. “What is you name young man?” The lecturer asked. He is a heavily bearded man such that when he speaks, you only see his teeth and not his lips. “My name is Oti.” I responded with a broad smile dancing on my face. “Keep reading hard. Only reading could have made you know this without attending my class. Mass Comm 100-Level, learn from him.” He said as he left the class. As soon as Mr Ovirikpo left, there was a serious rush towards one corner of the hall. Someone was holding a sheet of paper trying to write something on it and other people were dragging it from him. “What is happening there?” I asked a lady standing just beside me. “They are writing names in the attendance sheet. It’s compulsory for everyone. That is what Mr Ovirikpo said.” She said. I quickly rushed to also write my name in the sheet of paper. But as we were dragging it, the paper got torn into two. In the end, the course rep whose name I later understood to be Nene used a water gum to hold it. I was unable to drag with the crowd, so I sat down and waited. I was the last to write my name. “The man will not even use the names.” The lady who was standing beside me said. She was now sitting down and there were now three of use in the hall: Nene the course rep, the lady and me. Soon, the course rep started going and I made to leave the hall too. “Excuse me.” The young lady who had waited behind said. “My name is Azizat. You are so smart and intelligent and I really like you. I want to be your girlfriend.” She said without mincing words. I know I’m handsome, but I did not know that a lady would boldly approach me. She stretched out her hands for a handshake. “I already picked your name. And I really liked how it sounds. So what do you say to my request? I want to be your girlfriend.” She said again. Azizat is a very beautiful lady. She has a very nice open teeth that parts like the Red Sea whenever she laughed. She was fair in complexion and had a hair that flowed on her shoulders. She was tall and her eyes were irresistibly cute. I wanted to tell her that I will think about it. I wanted to let her know that it was not good for a lady to ask a man out, that it is not our culture. I wanted to tell her an emphatic no. I wanted to tell her that I’m in UNILAG to study and not to do girlfriend and boyfriend. I wanted to (truncated)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Minister of Health and Public Hygiene immerses himself in its implementation in Ziniaré in the central plateau region
(Ziniaré, September 15, 2023). The Oubri Yaoghin health district of Ziniaré, located 7 km from Ziniaré, was the point of convergence on the morning of Friday September 15, 2023, of the Minister of Health and Public Hygiene, Dr Robert Kargougou and his colleagues , accompanied by administrative officials in order to demonstrate the implementation of the Chemotherapy campaign for the prevention of seasonal malaria.
This field visit to the Oubri Yaoghin health district of Ziniaré, followed by visits to rural concessions, is part of the Chemo prevention campaign for seasonal malaria, with the aim of strongly encouraging the taking of medication by children of the age range of 3 to 59 months.
Led from start to finish by Community Based Health Workers (CBHC), the campaign consists of identifying the children concerned, identifying possible cases of malnutrition, looking for edema, and finally administering medication to these children.
For the Minister of Health and Public Hygiene, Dr. Robert Kargougou, chemoprevention of seasonal malaria consists of administering medications to children aged 3 to 59 months over a period of three (3) days. Still according to him, the administration of these drugs to children helps protect them against the occurrence of malaria.
In relation to the destruction of larval breeding sites only in the cities of Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso, the first head of the health department will say that this is due to the fact that they are firstly in a pilot phase, but also due to the prevalence of dengue fever particularly in these two (2) localities. Otherwise, in the long term, according to Dr Robert Kargougou, the destruction of larval breeding sites will take place across the entire national territory.
In relation to the progress of the Chemo-prevention of malaria campaign in areas with strong security challenges, the minister gave the assurance that these areas are not overlooked. As proof, he cites the ongoing action of ASBCs in this direction, particularly in the Sahel, Center-North, North, East and Boucle du Mouhoun regions.
For Tiendrebeogo Georgette, mother of eligible children, she has now been receiving the medications and administering them to these children for two (2) years. To this end, she confided that if medicines are administered normally to children, they resist the malaria sensitive period correctly.
This was an opportunity for Lady Tiendrebeogo to appeal to women not to hesitate to take these medications and administer them normally to their children in order to prevent them from falling ill.

As we remember her, it is essential to delve deeper into her story, for Justina was not merely a casualty of the virus, but a pregnant woman whose dreams of motherhood were tragically cut short. Born and raised in the vibrant community of Onicha, Ezinihitte Mbaise in Imo State, Justina Ejelonu embodied the spirit of resilience and dedication that defines healthcare professionals. Her selflessness knew no bounds, for despite the risks and dangers posed by this deadly virus, Justina relentlessly cared for those afflicted by it. And in doing so, she became a symbol of hope amidst the darkness that encompassed her. In her last moments, Justina fought valiantly to protect both her own life and that of her unborn child. Her courage and unwavering commitment to her duty were unparalleled, as she fearlessly confronted a formidable opponent, battling for the lives of others even as her own hung in the balance. But let us not forget that Justina Ejelonu was not alone in her sacrifice. Mrs. Evelyn Uko, a dedicated ward maid, also succumbed to the perils of Ebola in the line of duty. Their shared fate serves as a poignant reminder of the countless unsung heroes who lay down their lives each day to preserve the well-being of others. In commemorating Justina Ejelonu, we must also acknowledge the extraordinary Dr. Stella Adadevoh, who played a pivotal role in identifying and containing the Ebola outbreak in Nigeria. Dr. Adadevoh's unwavering determination and astute medical expertise were instrumental in safeguarding countless lives and her tragic demise serves as a stark reminder of the fragility that healthcare professionals face when standing against the dangers that plague our world. Let us strive to ensure that the memory of Nurse Justina Ejelonu, along with the countless healthcare workers who have sacrificed their lives for the greater good, remains alive within our collective consciousness. Through recognizing their immeasurable contributions and deepening our understanding of their stories, we can honor their legacies and inspire a future where such sacrifices are no longer necessary. May their selflessness and courage continue to guide us towards building a healthier, more compassionate world for all.","['capacity', 'case-reporting']",['ebola'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Work hard. A fokontany chief from an upscale neighborhood in the city of Antananarivo convened a household during the week of the polio vaccination campaign, which took place from September 5 to 8. “He raised his voice against our agents. He denigrated them and castigated this vaccination campaign. He said, among other things, that he does not receive a free dose of vaccine. I summoned him to call him to order,” said this president of fokontany yesterday. Several residents of this fokontany slammed the door in the face of the vaccinators, who were going door to door to immunize everyone against polio. “The health workers no longer returned to these houses where there were refusals, during the sweeps, to avoid tensions,” he continues. Not all targets, newborns, children, young people and adults, are reached, according to the confidences of some health workers and community workers in the Analamanga region. “The number of people vaccinated in our sector has decreased compared to the previous campaign. The targets are increasingly suspicious of this repetitive vaccination,” confides a doctor. Others have a coverage rate above 100%, but these would not be the main targets which have completed this vaccination coverage.",['vaccine-efficacy'],['polio'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In some parts of Mulanje however, entire families are reported to have refused to be vaccinated due to religious and traditional beliefs.

There are 5 crimes that the Americans never let go: the p€d@ph_!lie, the tax evasion, drug trafficking, hacking and terrorism. If you want, go get a gun, enter a supermarket and because you are angry with your colleagues or your classmates who make fun of you, empty your magazine. On the same day, you will find voices defending the carrying of weapons and some of the most experienced psychologists to explain to you, the families of the deceased, that if your parents carried weapons on the day of the tragedy, they would have been able to neutralize the assailant. . As a result, the first person responsible for the death of your loved ones is the government, which failed to provide a security response to the impulses of a man over whom Satan has taken control. But if ever on the very day of the shooting, in Abidjan, three Ivorians meet around a drink at the bar of a palace and discuss this, they will be hunted for the rest of their lives by the Americans: a project which consists of bringing cocaine in Ivory Coast. Sell a small part locally and export the bulk of the remainder to (1) Czech Republic and (2) Austria. Launder in Abidjan in real estate local sales. Swap this cargo that entered the Czech Republic and Austria for weapons (3) from Ukraine. Bring these weapons into (4) Ghana with Russian fertilizers from a supplier in (5) Poland. And finally, export these weapons to (6) Colombia from Ghana, hidden in loads of raw lead. These 5 transit countries play a particular role that I will not explain, except in the case of Ghana, because it is no longer possible. These facts took place between 2012 and 2017 and were made public on Tuesday July 25, 2017 by press release for immediate distribution and emanating from the US Attorney's Office, Southern District of New York in the USA. Here are some extracts: “An Ivorian citizen named Faouzi Jaber, alias “Your Excellency” pleaded guilty to conspiracy to provide material support to the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (“FARC”), a terrorist organization (... ) Jaber organized the trafficking of deadly weapons and narcotics worth millions of dollars to support the FARC's efforts to violently overthrow the Colombian government and terrorize U.S. forces stationed there... Jaber agreed to provide surface-to-air missiles with the understanding that these weapons were to be used by the FARC against U.S. forces in Colombia. » Jaber was arrested during a special operation along with two other of his accomplices in Prague. The latter two were exchanged for four Czech hostages held by another terrorist group based in Lebanon. The case of the head of the Jaber group, an Ivorian national, was not the subject of bargaining. Indeed, the prosecutor refused any negotiation given, and I quote, the “highly lethal nature of the organization set up by Jabber. » In 2020, during the Covid crisis, Jabber requested release for health reasons. The judge's response “The convicted person was at the origin of a project aimed at selling a military arsenal to terrorists to harm American soldiers. Accordingly, early release is completely unjustified, even if Jaber faced beyond-life-threatening health consequences. The request for release on humanitarian grounds is therefore rejected!” In easy French it means “Even if the Covid crisis doesn’t matter. » In fact, in his explanations which are public, the prosecutor explains that Jabber was too cynical. He and accomplices imported waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) into Ghana. Stored in the Agbogbloshie landfill, one of the largest landfills of its kind in the world, these are children poisoning themselves trying to extract lead from old computers. This raw lead was then legally exported to Colombia because it is used to manufacture ammunition used by the regular army. But lead has the particularity, when it is dense, of blurring X-rays. This is the reason why the weapons in spare parts were hidden in these lead shipments. In the end Jabber, according to his own admissions, sent from Ghana both lead for the regular army and weapons hidden in this lead, to sagba the soldiers of the regular army and the Americans. The Prosecutor saw red... NB: since this affair, Colombia has stopped its imports of raw lead from Ghana outside of certain strict conditions certified by the Ghanaian government. To understand the anger of the American Prosecutor, and the cynical character of Jaber, you have to visit this dump that I know from having looked through it (truncated) | Photos from Jean Christian Konan / Analysis blog's post",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
